N2  - BACKGROUND: Exercise rehabilitation is a promising strategy for reducing cardiovascular disease risk among patients with breast cancer. However, the evidence is primarily derived from programs based at exercise centers with in-person supervised delivery. Conversely, most patients report a preference for home-based rehabilitation. As such, there is a clear need to explore strategies that can provide real-time supervision and coaching while addressing consumer preferences. Evidence from cardiac rehabilitation has demonstrated the noninferiority of a smartphone-based telerehabilitation approach (REMOTE-CR) to improve cardiorespiratory fitness in people with cardiovascular disease compared to a center-based program., OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the feasibility, safety, and preliminary efficacy of the REMOTE-CR program adapted for patients with breast cancer at risk of cardiotoxicity (REMOTE-COR-B). We will also assess the satisfaction and usability of REMOTE-COR-B., METHODS: We will conduct a single-arm feasibility study of the REMOTE-COR-B program among patients with stage I-III breast cancer who are at risk of cardiotoxicity (taking treatment type and dose, as well as other common cardiovascular disease risk factors into account) and who are within 24 months of completing primary definitive treatment. Participants (target sample size of 40) will receive an 8-week smartphone-based telerehabilitation exercise program involving remotely delivered real-time supervision and behavior change support. The platform comprises a smartphone and wearable heart rate monitor, as well as a custom-built smartphone app and web application. Participants will be able to attend remotely monitored exercise sessions during set operating hours each week, scheduled in both the morning and evening. Adherence is the primary outcome of the trial, assessed through the number of remotely monitored exercise sessions attended compared to the trial target (ie, 3 sessions per week). Secondary outcomes include additional trial feasibility indicators (eg, recruitment and retention), safety, satisfaction, and usability, and objective and patient-reported efficacy outcomes (cardiovascular fitness, quality of life, fatigue, self-reported exercise, self-efficacy, habit strength, and motivation). Adherence, feasibility, and safety outcomes will be assessed during the intervention period; intervention satisfaction and usability will be assessed post intervention; and objective and patient-reported efficacy outcomes will be assessed at baseline, post intervention (2-month postbaseline assessment), and at follow-up (5-month postbaseline assessment)., RESULTS: Recruitment for this trial commenced in March 2023, and 7 participants had been recruited as of the submission of the manuscript. The estimated completion date for the project is October 2024, with results expected to be published in mid-2025., CONCLUSIONS: The REMOTE-COR-B intervention is a novel and promising approach to providing exercise therapy to patients with breast cancer at risk of cardiotoxicity who have unique needs and heightened safety risks. This project will provide important information on the extent to which this approach is satisfactory to patients with breast cancer, safe, and potentially effective, which is necessary before larger-scale research or clinical projects., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12621001557820; www.anzctr.org.au/ACTRN12621001557820.aspx., INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/53301.

N2  - (1) Background: Cardiac rehabilitation often emphasizes aerobic capacity while overlooking the importance of muscle strength. This study evaluated the impact of an enhanced remote strength training program (RCR-ST) on cardiac rehabilitation. (2) Methods: In this randomized prospective study (RCT registration number SMC-9080-22), 50 patients starting cardiac rehabilitation were assessed for muscle strength, aerobic capacity, and self-reported outcomes at baseline and after 16 weeks. Participants were divided into two groups: the RCR-ST group received a targeted resistance training program via a mobile app and smartwatch, while the control group received standard care with general resistance training advice. (3) Results: The RCR-ST group demonstrated significant improvements in muscle endurance, notably in leg extension and chest press exercises, with increases of 92% compared to 25% and 92% compared to 13% in the control group, respectively. Functional assessments (5-STS and TUG tests) also showed marked improvements in agility, coordination, and balance. Both groups improved in cardiorespiratory fitness, similarly. The RCR-ST group reported enhanced physical health and showed increased engagement, as evidenced by more frequent use of the mobile app and longer participation in the rehabilitation program (p < 0.05). (4) Conclusions: Incorporating a focused strength training regimen in remote cardiac rehabilitation significantly improves muscle endurance and patient engagement. The RCR-ST program presents a promising approach for optimizing patient outcomes by addressing a crucial gap in traditional rehabilitation protocols that primarily focus on aerobic training.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac rehabilitation programs, consisting of exercise training and disease management interventions, reduce morbidity and mortality after acute myocardial infarction., OBJECTIVE: In this pilot study, we aimed to developed and assess the feasibility of delivering a health watch-informed 12-week cardiac telerehabilitation program to acute myocardial infarction survivors who declined to participate in center-based cardiac rehabilitation., METHODS: We enrolled patients hospitalized after acute myocardial infarction at an academic medical center who were eligible for but declined to participate in center-based cardiac rehabilitation. Each participant underwent a baseline exercise stress test. Participants received a health watch, which monitored heart rate and physical activity, and a tablet computer with an app that displayed progress toward accomplishing weekly walking and exercise goals. Results were transmitted to a cardiac rehabilitation nurse via a secure connection. For 12 weeks, participants exercised at home and also participated in weekly phone counseling sessions with the nurse, who provided personalized cardiac rehabilitation solutions and standard cardiac rehabilitation education. We assessed usability of the system, adherence to weekly exercise and walking goals, counseling session attendance, and disease-specific quality of life., RESULTS: Of 18 participants (age: mean 59 years, SD 7) who completed the 12-week telerehabilitation program, 6 (33%) were women, and 6 (33%) had ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Participants wore the health watch for a median of 12.7 hours (IQR 11.1, 13.8) per day and completed a median of 86% of exercise goals. Participants , on average, walked 121 minutes per week (SD 175) and spent 189 minutes per week (SD 210) in their target exercise heart rate zone. Overall, participants found the system to be highly usable (System Usability Scale score: median 83, IQR 65, 100)., CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study established the feasibility of delivering cardiac telerehabilitation at home to acute myocardial infarction survivors via a health watch-based program and telephone counseling sessions. Usability and adherence to health watch use, exercise recommendations, and counseling sessions were high. Further studies are warranted to compare patient outcomes and health care resource utilization between center-based rehabilitation and telerehabilitation.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Remote telemonitoring holds great potential to augment management of patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and atrial fibrillation (AF) by enabling regular physiological monitoring during physical activity. Remote physiological monitoring may improve home and community exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (exCR) programs and could improve assessment of the impact and management of pharmacological interventions for heart rate control in individuals with AF., OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to evaluate the measurement validity and data transmission reliability of a remote telemonitoring system comprising a wireless multi-parameter physiological sensor, custom mobile app, and middleware platform, among individuals in sinus rhythm and AF., METHODS: Participants in sinus rhythm and with AF undertook simulated daily activities, low, moderate, and/or high intensity exercise. Remote monitoring system heart rate and respiratory rate were compared to reference measures (12-lead ECG and indirect calorimeter). Wireless data transmission loss was calculated between the sensor, mobile app, and remote Internet server., RESULTS: Median heart rate (-0.30 to 1.10 b.min-1) and respiratory rate (-1.25 to 0.39 br.min-1) measurement biases were small, yet statistically significant (all P<=.003) due to the large number of observations. Measurement reliability was generally excellent (rho=.87-.97, all P<.001; intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]=.94-.98, all P<.001; coefficient of variation [CV]=2.24-7.94%), although respiratory rate measurement reliability was poor among AF participants (rho=.43, P<.001; ICC=.55, P<.001; CV=16.61%). Data loss was minimal (<5%) when all system components were active; however, instability of the network hosting the remote data capture server resulted in data loss at the remote Internet server during some trials., CONCLUSIONS: System validity was sufficient for remote monitoring of heart and respiratory rates across a range of exercise intensities. Remote exercise monitoring has potential to augment current exCR and heart rate control management approaches by enabling the provision of individually tailored care to individuals outside traditional clinical environments.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) delivered by rehabilitation specialists in a healthcare setting is effective in improving functional capacity and reducing readmission rates after cardiac surgery. It is also associated with a reduction in cardiac mortality and recurrent myocardial infarction. This trial assesses the feasibility of a home-based CR programme delivered using a mobile application (app)., METHODS: The Rehabilitation through Exercise prescription for Cardiac patients using an Artificial intelligence web-based Programme (RECAP) randomised controlled feasibility trial is a single-centre prospective study, in which patients will be allocated on a 1:1 ratio to a home-based CR programme delivered using a mobile app with accelerometers or standard hospital-based rehabilitation classes. The home-based CR programme will employ artificial intelligence to prescribe exercise goals to the participants on a weekly basis. The trial will recruit 70 patients in total. The primary objectives are to evaluate participant recruitment and dropout rates, assess the feasibility of randomisation, determine acceptability to participants and staff, assess the rates of potential outcome measures and determine hospital resource allocation to inform the design of a larger randomised controlled trial for clinical efficacy and health economic evaluation. Secondary objectives include evaluation of health-related quality of life and 6 minute walk distance., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: RECAP trial received a favourable outcome from the Berkshire research ethics committee in September 2022 (IRAS 315483). Trial results will be made available through publication in peer-reviewed journals and presented at relevant scientific meetings., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN97352737.

N2  - Remote cardiac rehabilitation (RCR) represents a promising, noninferior alternative to facility-based cardiac rehabilitation (FBCR). The comparable cost of RCR in US populations has yet to be extensively studied. The purpose of this prospective, patient-selected study of traditional FBCR versus a third-party asynchronous RCR platform was to assess whether RCR can be administered at a comparable cost and clinical efficacy to FBCR. Adult insured patients were eligible for enrollment after an admission for a coronary heart disease event. Patients selected either FBCR or Movn RCR, a 12-week telehealth intervention using an app-based platform and internet-capable medical devices. Clinical demographics, intervention adherence, cost-effectiveness, and hospitalizations at 1-year after enrollment were assessed from the Highmark claims database after propensity matching between groups. A total of 260 patients were included and 171 of those eligible (65.8%) received at least 1 cardiac rehabilitation session and half of the patients chose Movn RCR. The propensity matching produced a sample of 41 matched pairs. Movn RCR led to a faster enrollment and higher completion rates (80% vs 50%). The total medical costs were similar between Movn RCR and FBCR, although tended toward cost savings with Movn RCR ($10,574/patient). The cost of cardiac rehabilitation was lower in those enrolled in Movn RCR ($1,377/patient, p = 0.002). The all-cause and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations or emergency department visits in the year after enrollment in both groups were similar. In conclusion, this pragmatic study of patients after a coronary heart disease event led to equivalent total medical costs and lower intervention costs for an asynchronous RCR platform than traditional FBCR while maintaining similar clinically important outcomes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The use of eHealth technology in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a promising approach to enhance patient outcomes since adherence to healthy lifestyles and risk factor management during phase III CR maintenance is often poorly supported. However, patients' needs and expectations have not been extensively analyzed to inform the design of such eHealth solutions., OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to provide a detailed patient perspective on the most important functionalities to include in an eHealth solution to assist them in phase III CR maintenance., METHODS: A guided survey as part of a Living Lab approach was conducted in Germany (n=49) and Spain (n=30) involving women (16/79, 20%) and men (63/79, 80%) with coronary artery disease (mean age 57 years, SD 9 years) participating in a structured center-based CR program. The survey covered patients' perceived importance of different CR components in general, current usage of technology/technical devices, and helpfulness of the potential features of eHealth in CR. Questionnaires were used to identify personality traits (psychological flexibility, optimism/pessimism, positive/negative affect), potentially predisposing patients to acceptance of an app/monitoring devices., RESULTS: All the patients in this study owned a smartphone, while 30%-40% used smartwatches and fitness trackers. Patients expressed the need for an eHealth platform that is user-friendly, personalized, and easily accessible, and 71% (56/79) of the patients believed that technology could help them to maintain health goals after CR. Among the offered components, support for regular physical exercise, including updated schedules and progress documentation, was rated the highest. In addition, patients rated the availability of information on diagnosis, current medication, test results, and risk scores as (very) useful. Of note, for each item, except smoking cessation, 35%-50% of the patients indicated a high need for support to achieve their long-term health goals, suggesting the need for individualized care. No major differences were detected between Spanish and German patients (all P>.05) and only younger age (P=.03) but not sex, education level, or personality traits (all P>.05) were associated with the acceptance of eHealth components., CONCLUSIONS: The patient perspectives collected in this study indicate high acceptance of personalized user-friendly eHealth platforms with remote monitoring to improve adherence to healthy lifestyles among patients with coronary artery disease during phase III CR maintenance. The identified patient needs comprise support in physical exercise, including regular updates on personalized training recommendations. Availability of diagnoses, laboratory results, and medications, as part of a mobile electronic health record were also rated as very useful., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05461729; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05461729.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Smartphone apps used in research offer a variety of capabilities to track and influence behavior; however, they often do not translate well into real-world use. Implementation strategies for using apps to reduce sedentary behavior in cardiac rehabilitation are currently unknown., OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore (1) barriers and enablers for use of a behavioral smartphone app (Vire and ToDo-CR program) for reducing sedentary behavior in cardiac rehabilitation participants and (2) implementation strategies for future smartphone apps aimed at reducing sedentary behavior in this population., METHODS: In-depth semistructured interviews were conducted with cardiac rehabilitation participants in the ToDo-CR randomized controlled trial. Participants had used the Vire app and a wearable activity tracker for 6 months. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. The researchers used thematic analysis and deductive mapping of themes to the Theoretical Domains Framework and the Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation-Behavior model. Sociodemographic and clinical variables were recorded., RESULTS: Fifteen participants aged 59 +/- 14 years were interviewed. Most were male, tertiary educated, and employed, and had varying experiences with smartphone apps and wearable activity trackers. Five core themes explaining the user experiences of cardiac rehabilitation participants with the Vire app were identified: (1) being tech savvy can be both an enabler and a barrier, (2) app messaging needs to be clear-set expectations from the beginning, (3) get to know me-personalization is important, (4) curious to know more instant feedback, and (5) first impression is key. The themes and subthemes mapped to 12 of the 14 Theoretical Domains Framework domains. Improving engagement and implementation of future smartphone apps for sedentary behavior may be aided by building psychological capability, physical opportunity, and reflective motivation., CONCLUSIONS: Shifting to in-the-moment behavioral nudges, setting clear expectations, assisting participants to monitor their sitting time, increasing the frequency of tailoring, and understanding more about the participant as well as their experiences and needs for reducing sedentary behavior in cardiac rehabilitation are important future directions.

N2  - BACKGROUND: People with coronary heart disease are at an increased risk of morbidity and mortality even if they attend cardiac rehabilitation. High sedentary behavior levels potentially contribute to this morbidity. Smartphone apps may be feasible to facilitate sedentary behavior reductions and lead to reduced health care use., OBJECTIVE: We aimed to test the effect of a sedentary behavior change smartphone app (Vire app and ToDo-CR program) as an adjunct to cardiac rehabilitation on hospital admissions and emergency department (ED) presentations over 12 months., METHODS: A multicenter, randomized controlled trial was conducted with 120 participants recruited from 3 cardiac rehabilitation programs. Participants were randomized 1:1 to cardiac rehabilitation plus the fully automated 6-month Vire app and ToDo-CR program (intervention) or usual care (control). The primary outcome was nonelective hospital admissions and ED presentations over 12 months. Secondary outcomes including accelerometer-measured sedentary behavior, BMI, waist circumference, and quality of life were recorded at baseline and 6 and 12 months. Logistic regression models were used to analyze the primary outcome, and linear mixed-effects models were used to analyze secondary outcomes. Data on intervention and hospital admission costs were collected, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated., RESULTS: Participants were, on average, aged 62 (SD 10) years, and the majority were male (93/120, 77.5%). The intervention group were more likely to experience all-cause (odds ratio [OR] 1.54, 95% CI 0.58-4.10; P=.39) and cardiac-related (OR 3.26, 95% CI 0.84-12.55; P=.09) hospital admissions and ED presentations (OR 2.07, 95% CI 0.89-4.77; P=.09) than the control group. Despite this, cardiac-related hospital admission costs were lower in the intervention group over 12 months (Aus $252.40 vs Aus $859.38; P=.24; a currency exchange rate of Aus $1=US $0.69 is applicable). There were no significant between-group differences in sedentary behavior minutes per day over 12 months, although the intervention group completed 22 minutes less than the control group (95% CI -22.80 to 66.69; P=.33; Cohen d=0.21). The intervention group had a lower BMI (beta=1.62; P=.05), waist circumference (beta=5.81; P=.01), waist-to-hip ratio (beta=.03, P=.03), and quality of life (beta=3.30; P=.05) than the control group. The intervention was more effective but more costly in reducing sedentary behavior (ICER Aus $351.77) and anxiety (ICER Aus $10,987.71) at 12 months. The intervention was also more effective yet costly in increasing quality of life (ICER Aus $93,395.50) at 12 months., CONCLUSIONS: The Vire app and ToDo-CR program was not an outcome-effective or cost-effective solution to reduce all-cause hospital admissions or ED presentations in cardiac rehabilitation compared with usual care. Smartphone apps that target sedentary behavior alone may not be an effective solution for cardiac rehabilitation participants to reduce hospital admissions and sedentary behavior., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) ACTRN12619001223123; https://australianclinicaltrials.gov.au/anzctr/trial/ACTRN12619001223123., INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): RR2-10.1136/bmjopen-2020-040479.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) improves outcomes in heart disease yet remains vastly underutilized. Remote CR enhanced with a digital health intervention (DHI) may offer higher access and improved patient-centered outcomes over non-technology approaches. We sought to pragmatically determine whether offering a DHI improves CR access, cardiac risk profile, and patient-reported outcome measures., METHODS: Adults referred to CR at a tertiary VA medical center between October 2017 and December 2021 were offered enrollment into a DHI alongside other CR modalities using shared decision-making. The DHI consisted of remote CR with a structured, 3-month home exercise program enhanced with multi-component coaching, a commercial smartphone app, and wearable activity tracker. We measured completion rates among DHI participants and evaluated changes in 6-min walk distance, cardiovascular risk factors, and patient-reported outcomes from pre- to post-intervention., RESULTS: Among 1,643 patients referred to CR, 258 (16%) consented to the DHI where the mean age was 60 +/- 9 years, 93% were male, and 48% were black. A majority (90%) of the DHI group completed the program. Over 3-months, significant improvements were seen in 6MWT (mean difference [MD] -29 m; 95% CI, 10 to 49; P < 0.01) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD -11 mg/dL; 95% CI, -17 to -5; P < 0.01), and the absolute proportion of patients who reported smoking decreased (10% vs 15%; MD, -5%; 95% CI, -8% to -2%; P < 0.01) among DHI participants with available data. No adverse events were reported., CONCLUSIONS: The addition of a DHI-enhanced remote CR program was delivered in 16% of referred veterans and associated with improved CR access, markers of cardiovascular risk, and healthy behaviors in this real-world study. These findings support the continued implementation of DHIs for remote CR in real-world clinical settings., TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02791685 (07/06/2016).

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Many hospital presentations for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) occur in people previously hospitalised with coronary heart disease (CHD), leading to increased costs and health burden. Secondary prevention education including a prehospital discharge plan is recommended for all individuals to reduce the risk of recurrence. However, many clinicians lack the time or support to provide education, and patients' uptake of secondary prevention programmes is limited. An avatar-based education app is a novel and engaging way to provide self-delivered, evidence-based secondary prevention information during the hospital admission and remains accessible after discharge. This protocol aims to evaluate the effect of an avatar-based education app on individuals with ACS., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This protocol describes a prospective, randomised controlled trial with 3-month follow-up and blinded assessment of 72 participants. Intervention group participants will download the app onto their own device during the hospital admission and independently complete six interactive education modules based on the National Heart Foundation's six steps to cardiac recovery. All participants will receive a text message reminder of the study after 3 weeks. Both groups will receive usual care consisting of bedside education and a pamphlet about cardiac rehabilitation. The primary outcome is knowledge of CHD, assessed using the Coronary Artery Disease Education Questionnaire II. Secondary outcomes include quality of life, response to heart attack symptoms, cardiac-related readmissions and mortality and modifiable cardiac risk factors. Engagement with the app will be evaluated objectively. Intention-to-treat analysis will be conducted, with between-group comparisons and 95% CIs of the primary outcome analysed using analysis of covariance, adjusting for baseline values., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study protocol has been approved by the Western Sydney Local Health District Human Research Ethics Committee. The results of this study will be disseminated via a peer-reviewed journal and research thesis., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12622001436763).

N2  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is underused in the United States and globally, with participation disparities across gender, socioeconomic status, race, and ethnicities. The pandemic led to greater adoption of telehealth CR and mobile app use., OBJECTIVE: Our primary objective was to estimate the association between CR mobile app use and change in functional capacity from enrollment to completion in patients participating in a CR program that offered in-person, hybrid, and telehealth CR. Our secondary objectives were to study the association between mobile app use and changes in blood pressure (BP) or program completion., METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of participants enrolled in CR at an urban CR program in the United States. Participants were English speaking, at least 18 years of age, participated in the program between May 22, 2020, and May 21, 2022, and downloaded the CR mobile app. Mobile app use was quantified by number of exercise logs, vitals logs, and education material views. The primary outcome was change in functional capacity, measured by change in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) from enrollment to completion. The secondary outcome was change in BP from enrollment to completion. We estimated associations using multivariable linear or logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status by ZIP code, insurance, and primary diagnosis for CR referral., RESULTS: A total of 107 participants (mean age 62.9, SD 13.02 years; 90/107, 84.1% male; and 57/105, 53.3% self-declared as White Caucasian) used the mobile app and completed the CR program. Participants had a mean 64.0 (SD 54.1) meter increase in 6MWD between enrollment and completion (P<.001). From enrollment to completion, participants with an elevated BP at baseline (>=130/80 mmHg) experienced a significant decrease in BP (systolic BP -11.5 mmHg; P=.002 and diastolic BP -7.7 mmHg; P=.003). We found no significant association between total app interactions and change in 6MWD (coefficient -0.03, 95% CI -0.1 to 0.07; P=.59) or change in BP (systolic coefficient 0.002, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.03; P=.87 and diastolic coefficient -0.005, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.02; P=.65). There was no significant association between total exercise logs and change in 6MWD (coefficient 0.1, 95% CI -0.3 to 0.4; P=.57) or total BP logs and change in BP (systolic coefficient -0.02, 95% CI -0.1 to 0.06; P=.63 and diastolic coefficient -0.02, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.04; P=.50). There was no significant association between total app interactions and completion of CR (adjusted odds ratio 1.00, 95% CI 0.99-1.01; P=.44)., CONCLUSIONS: CR mobile app use as part of an in-person, hybrid, or telehealth CR program was not associated with greater improvement in functional capacity or BP or with program completion.

N2  - Cardiac rehabilitation after acute myocardial infarction is crucial and improves patients' prognosis. It aims to optimize cardiovascular risk factors' control. Providing additional support via mobile applications has been previously suggested. However, data from prospective, randomized trials evaluating digital solutions are scarce. In this study, we aimed to evaluate a mobile application-afterAMI-in the clinical setting and to investigate the impact of a digitally-supported model of care in comparison with standard rehabilitation. A total of 100 patients after myocardial infarction were enrolled. Patients were randomized into groups with either a rehabilitation program and access to afterAMI or standard rehabilitation alone. The primary endpoint was rehospitalizations and/or urgent outpatient visits after 6 months. Cardiovascular risk factors' control was also analyzed. Median age was 61 years; 65% of the participants were male. This study failed to limit the number of primary endpoint events (8% with app vs. 27% without app; p = 0.064). However, patients in the interventional group had lower NT-proBNP levels (p = 0.0231) and better knowledge regarding cardiovascular disease risk factors (p = 0.0009), despite no differences at baseline. This study showcases how a telemedical tool can be used in the clinical setting.

N2  - Aims: Secondary prevention reduces coronary heart disease (CHD) progression. Traditional prevention programs including cardiac rehabilitation are under-accessed, which smartphone apps may overcome. To evaluate the effect of a game-based mobile app intervention (MyHeartMate) to improve cardiovascular risk factors and lifestyle behaviours., Methods and results: Single-blind randomized trial of CHD patients in Sydney, 2017-2021. Intervention group were provided the MyHeartMate app for 6 months. Co-designed features included an avatar of the patient's heart and tokens earned by risk factor work (tracking, challenges, and quizzes). The control group received usual care. Primary outcome was self-reported physical activity [metabolic equivalents (METs), Global Physical Activity Questionnaire] and secondary outcomes included lipid levels, blood pressure (BP), body mass index, and smoking. Pre-specified sample size was achieved (n = 390), age 61.2 +/- 11.5 years; 82.5% men and 9.2% current smokers. At 6 months, adjusted for baseline levels, the intervention group achieved more physical activity than control (median difference 329 MET mins/wk), which was not statistically significant (95% CI -37.4, 696; P = 0.064). No differences occurred between groups on secondary outcomes except for lower triglyceride levels in the intervention [mean difference -0.3 (95% CI -0.5, -0.1 mmoL/L, P = 0.004)]. Acceptability was high: 94.8% of intervention participants engaged by tracking exercise or BP and completing missions; 26.8% continued to engage for >=30 days. Participants (n = 14) reported the app supported tracking behaviours and risk factors, reinforcing and improving self-care confidence, and decreasing anxiety., Conclusion: A game-based app proved highly acceptable for patients with CHD but did not improve risk factors or lifestyle behaviours other than triglyceride levels.

N2  - Background: The use of health-related mobile apps has become an important component of healthcare. Patients can use a range of tools to strengthen their health literacy and promote disease management. The aim of the project was to develop a web-based application for use on smartphones, tablets and computers for patients with cardiovascular diseases (cardio-app)., Methods: A semi-standardized written survey was conducted among rehabilitation patients with cardiovascular diseases (n = 158). The usability of the cardio-app was assessed using the System Usability Scale (SUS). The usage behaviour was conducted with a self-developed questionnaire., Results: The study enrolled 158 eligible rehabilitation patients. The SUS of the cardio-app determined was 74.4 (SD +/- 17.4). For 86%, the menu navigation was self-explanatory and logical. The visual presentation appealed to 92% of respondents. The content of the texts used in the app was understandable for 95%, and 93% found the technical terms used in the glossary well explained. For 57%, the app was helpful in planning their physical activities. 83% of the rehabilitation patients would recommend the app to others. The main criticisms of the app were the lack of synchronization options with other apps. Of those who did not use the app, the following reasons for non-use were most frequently cited: too much effort (43%), lack of time (29%) and pandemic-related reasons (29%)., Conclusions: The cardio-app revealed high agreement values. Whether the use of the app is associated with improved clinical state and outcome would have to be verified in further studies. Copyright © The Author(s) 2023.

N2  - Background: Digital health technologies have potential to address the challenges associated with traditional cardiac rehabilitation (CR). However, it is not complete enough for prescribed exercise guidance and remote monitoring., Objective: We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a smartphone app for prescribed exercise tutoring by exercise videos combined with wearable devices to monitor heart rate in patients with stable coronary heart disease (CHD)., Methods: The study is a quasi-experimental design study with a single group. A total of 31 patients were included with an average age of 56.2 years (SD 13.4). They participated in a 12-week remote digital CR program. We employed a wearable heart rate monitoring device connected with an app to monitor the patients' exercise intensity. The app can display the videos corresponding to an exercise prescription to guide the exercise. Cardiorespiratory endurance, blood pressure, blood glucose, cholesterol, blood uric acid, left ventricular ejection fraction and quality of life (QoL) were assessed at the beginning and end of the intervention. Compliance and safety events were recorded as well., Results: Completion rate reached 90.3%. Average daily effective exercise time was 39.4 min (SD 17.8), and 92.9% of the patients could exercise in the prescribed intensity for at least 20 min per day. Average effective exercise days per week were 4.6 days (SD 2.2), and 67.9% of the patients could exercise in the prescribed intensity for at least 3 days per week. Patients' peak VO2 (P = 0.041) and peak metabolic equivalents (P = 0.018) were significantly increased, low-density lipoprotein (P = 0.036) and diastolic blood pressure at rest (P = 0.044) were significantly decreased, and depression (GAD-7, P = 0.014) and anxiety (PHQ-9, P = 0.013) were significantly improved., Conclusions: It is feasible, safe, and helpful for stable CHD patients to use the app for prescribed exercise tutoring with videos combined with wearable devices to monitor heart rate., Trial Registration: ChiCTR1800019144.

N2  - Wearable activity monitors, together with smartphone-based health and fitness applications (apps), are becoming more accessible and their widespread use provides an additional opportunity for the recording of cardiovascular metrics in patients with cardiovascular disease. The use of selected metrics by cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programmes allows the facilitation of individualized and tailored positive lifestyle changes to patients and places the patient at the centre of their recovery programme. To investigate the role of such devices on outcomes with patients on a CR programme, a cohort/case-control study was conducted. Patients post-myocardial infarction who were treated with either percutaneous coronary intervention or surgical coronary revascularisation at a single centre were invited to use a physical activity monitor linked to a customized app at their initial assessment for the rehabilitation programme. Those who accepted were allocated to the treatment group. The control group was selected from a larger pool of 400 historical and concurrent patients. Propensity matching was used to associate each case with their closest control. The changes in self-reported physical activity were similar for both groups at the end of the CR programme (EOP). The digitally monitored group tended to achieve greater METS (metabolic equivalent of task - a measure of exercise intensity) at 12 weeks (P < 0.059); however, no difference was observed in the overall change in METS at EOP (P < 0.333). Although no difference was noted in diastolic blood pressure, a statistically significant drop in the systolic blood pressure in the digitally monitored group (P < 0.004) was detected. In this study, the innovative combination of technology and face-to-face CR showed promising results and assisted the individualization of delivered content. This intervention could easily be replicated and expanded. Challenges are the recruitment of the elderly population, those who may be less engaged with or have less access to technology, and the underrepresentation of women in the study sample.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Patients with multimorbidity and complex health needs are defined as a priority by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Union. There is a need to develop appropriate strategies with effective measures to meet the challenge of chronicity, reorienting national health systems. The increasing expansion of mobile health (mHealth) interventions in patient communication, the reduction of health inequalities, improved access to health care resources, adherence to treatment, and self-care of chronic diseases all point to an optimistic outlook. However, only few mobile apps demonstrate their effectiveness in these patients, which is diminished when they are not based on evidence, or when they are not designed by and for users with different levels of health literacy (HL)., OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of an mHealth intervention relative to routine clinical practice in improving HL and self-management in patients with multimorbidity with heart failure (HF) and complex health needs., METHODS: This is a randomized, multicenter, blinded clinical trial evaluating 2 groups, namely, a control group (standard clinical practice) and an intervention group (standard clinical practice and an ad hoc designed mHealth intervention previously developed), for 12 months., RESULTS: The contents of the mHealth intervention will address user-perceived needs based on the development of user stories regarding diet, physical exercise, cardiac rehabilitation, therapeutic adherence, warning signs and symptoms, and emotional management. These contents have been validated by expert consensus. The creation and development of the contents of the mHealth intervention (app) took 18 months and was completed during 2021. The mobile app is expected to be developed by the end of 2022, after which it will be applied to the experimental group as an adjunct to standard clinical care during 12 months., CONCLUSIONS: The trial will demonstrate whether the mobile app improves HL and self-management in patients with HF and complex health needs, improves therapeutic adherence, and reduces hospital admissions. This study can serve as a starting point for developing other mHealth tools in other pathologies and for their generalization to other contexts., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04725526; https://tinyurl.com/bd8va27w., INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/35945.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a crucial part of the treatment of patients with cardiac diseases, and adherence to healthy behavior is a prerequisite to improve long-term prognosis. Unfortunately, adherence to healthy behavior adapted in CR is challenging for many cardiac patients in the long term. Recently, we demonstrated that follow-up conducted via an app for 1 year significantly improved adherence to healthy behavior after CR. To increase the knowledge and understanding of mobile Health (mHealth) interventions that can promote acceptance and adherence, qualitative research investigating patients' experiences with these interventions is warranted., OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate patient experiences with individualized long-term follow-up conducted via an app for 1 year and their thoughts about what features promoted adherence to healthy behavior after CR. The purpose was to increase the understanding of significant findings previously reported and to guide future development of similar interventions in the field of adherence., METHODS: A qualitative study with individual interviews was conducted from November 2018 to May 2019. A thematic interview guide was used when conducting the semistructured in-depth interviews. The interviews were audio recorded and transcribed successively during the period in which the interviews were conducted. Texts were managed and systematized by NVivo. Interviews were analyzed by qualitative content analysis. Codes and themes were inductively developed., RESULTS: Ten patients who had participated in a randomized controlled trial evaluating the effect of follow-up conducted via an app on adherence to healthy behavior after CR were included. The median patient age was 65 years (range 46-72 years), and both genders were represented. The analysis resulted in the following 4 themes describing the patients' experiences: (1) The person behind the app is crucial for motivation and adherence; (2) The app as a commitment; (3) The app as a path to independence; and (4) Suggestions for improvements. Features experienced as beneficial to promote adherence were individualized feedback and the use of goal setting. The significance of the person behind the app (the supervisor) who provided individualized feedback was a consistent finding. This person seemed to promote motivation in general and to enable other known behavioral change techniques., CONCLUSIONS: The person behind the app (the supervisor) seems to be one of the most significant success factors in promoting adherence to healthy behavior after CR. This indicates that a health care provider must actively participate in a patient's process of adherence to healthy behavior, even when using interventions, including an app. Future development of interventions in the field of adherence should strive to create tools that enable an ongoing collaborative relationship between the patient and the health care provider. The follow-up should be based on the patient's own goals, and individualized feedback should be provided.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Poor patient uptake of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) remains a challenge for multiple reasons including geographic, time, cultural, cost, and psychological constraints., OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the impact on CR participation rates associated with the addition of the option of mobile app-based CR (Cardihab) for patients declining conventional CR., METHODS: A total of 204 consecutive patients were offered CR following angioplasty; of these, 99 were in cohort 1 (offered conventional CR only) and 105 were in cohort 2 (app-based CR offered to those declining conventional CR). Patients in each cohort were followed throughout a 6-week CR program and participation rates were compared for both groups. Patients in cohort 2 declining both forms of CR were interviewed to assess reasons for nonparticipation., RESULTS: CR participation improved from 21% (95% CI 14%-30%) to 63% (95% CI 53%-71%) with the addition of the app (P<.001). Approximately 25% (9/39) of the group declining the app-based program identified technology issues as the reason for nonparticipation. The remainder declined both CR programs or were ineligible due to frailty or comorbidities., CONCLUSIONS: Providing patients with the additional option of an app-based CR program substantially improved CR participation. Technology and psychological barriers can limit CR participation. Further innovation in CR delivery systems is required to improve uptake.

N2  - Background: We performed a trial to evaluate the efficacy of a blended intervention with personalized health coaching and virtual cardiac rehabilitation to improve medication adherence and risk factors. The trial was terminated early. Here, we describe findings from a root cause analysis and lessons learned., Methods: SmartGUIDE was an open-label, single-center trial that randomized participants with coronary artery disease who were prescribed a statin and/or P2Y12 inhibitor 1:1 to either usual care or the added use of a mobile app with components of cardiac rehabilitation paired with personal virtual coaching. The primary outcome was medication adherence: proportion of days covered (PDC). The planned sample size was 132. We performed a root cause analysis to evaluate processes from study development to closure., Results: During trial conduct, the technology start-up withdrew the intervention. The study was terminated early with 63 participants randomized and data from 26 available for analysis. The median PDC was high in both groups (intervention group 94%, interquartile range [IQR] 88%-96%; control group: 99%, IQR 95%-100%). Root cause analysis identified factors for not achieving trial objectives: key factors that limited enrollment (inclusion criteria, low penetration of compatible smartphones), participant retention or engagement (poor app product, insufficient technology support), and suboptimal choice of a technology partner (technology start-up's inexperience in health care, poor product design, inadequate fundraising)., Conclusion: We identified important and preventable factors leading to trial failure. These factors may be common across digital health trials and may explain prior observations that many such trials are never completed. Careful vetting of technology partners and more pragmatic study designs may prevent these missteps.

N2  - BACKGROUND: A novel smartphone app-based model of care (TeleClinical Care - TCC) for patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and heart failure (HF) was evaluated in a two-site, pilot randomised control trial of 164 participants in Sydney, Australia. The program included a telemonitoring system whereby abnormal blood pressure, weight and heart rate readings were monitored by a central clinical team, who subsequently referred clinically significant alerts to the patients' usual general practitioner (GP, also known as primary care physician in the United States), HF nurse or cardiologist. While the primary endpoint, 30-day readmissions, was neutral, intervention arm participants demonstrated improvements in readmission rates over 6 months, cardiac rehabilitation (CR) completion and medication compliance. A process evaluation was designed to identify contextual factors and mechanisms that influenced the results, as well as strategies of improving site and participant recruitment and the delivery of the intervention, for a planned larger effectiveness trial of over 1,000 patients across the state of New South Wales, Australia (TCC-Cardiac)., METHODS: Multiple data sources were used in this mixed-methods process evaluation, including interviews with four TCC team members, three GPs and three cardiologists. CR completion rates, HF outreach service (HFOS) referrals and cardiologist follow-up appointments were audited. A patient questionnaire was also analysed for evidence of improved self-care as a hypothesised mechanism of the TCC app. An implementation research logic model was used to synthesise our findings., RESULTS: Rates of HFOS referral (83 vs. 72%) and cardiologist follow-up (96 vs. 93%) were similarly high in the intervention and control arms, respectively. Team members were largely positive towards their orientation and training, but highlighted several implementation strategies that could be optimised for TCC-Cardiac: streamlining of the enrolment process, improving the reach of the trial by screening patients in non-cardiac wards, and ensuring team members had adequate time to recruit (>15 h per week). GPs and cardiologists viewed the intervention acceptably regarding potential benefit of closely monitoring, and responding to abnormalities for their patients, though there were concerns of the potential additional workload generated by alerts that did not merit clinical intervention. Clear delineation of which clinician (GP or cardiologist) was primarily responsible for alert management was also recommended, as well as a preference to receive regular summary data. Several patients commented on the mechanisms of improved self-management because of TCC, which could have led to the outcome of improved medication compliance., DISCUSSION: Use of TCC was associated with several benefits, including higher patient engagement and completion rates with CR. The conduct and delivery of TCC-Cardiac will be improved by the findings of this process evaluation to optimise recruitment, and establishing the roles of GPs and cardiologists as part of the model.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Despite strong evidence of clinical benefit, cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs are currently underutilized and smartphone-based CR strategies are thought to address this unmet need. However, data regarding the detailed process of development are scarce., OBJECTIVE: This study focused on the development of a smartphone-based, patient-specific, messaging app for patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)., METHODS: The AnSim app was developed in collaboration with a multidisciplinary team that included cardiologists, psychiatrists, nurses, pharmacists, nutritionists, and rehabilitation doctors and therapists. First, a focus group interview was conducted, and the narratives of the patients were analyzed to identify their needs and preferences. Based on the results, health care experts and clinicians drafted messages into 5 categories: (1) general information regarding cardiovascular health and medications, (2) nutrition, (3) physical activity, (4) destressing, and (5) smoking cessation. In each category, 90 messages were developed according to 3 simplified steps of the transtheoretical model of behavioral change: (1) precontemplation, (2) contemplation and preparation, and (3) action and maintenance. After an internal review and feedback from potential users, a bank of 450 messages was developed., RESULTS: The focus interview was conducted with 8 patients with PCI within 1 year, and 450 messages, including various forms of multimedia, were developed based on the transtheoretical model of behavioral change in each category. Positive feedback was obtained from the potential users (n=458). The mean Likert scale score was 3.95 (SD 0.39) and 3.91 (SD 0.39) for readability and usefulness, respectively, and several messages were refined based on the feedback. Finally, the patient-specific message delivery system was developed according to the baseline characteristics and stages of behavioral change in each participant., CONCLUSIONS: We developed an app (AnSim), which includes a bank of 450 patient-specific messages, that provides various medical information and CR programs regarding coronary heart disease. The detailed process of multidisciplinary collaboration over the course of the study provides a scientific basis for various medical professionals planning smartphone-based clinical research.

N2  - Purpose: We evaluated the long-term effect of a smartphone-facilitated home-based cardiac rehabilitation (HBCR) model in revascularized patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) on major adverse cardiac events (MACE), and secondary outcomes, including safety, quality of life, and physical capacity. Methods: It was a prospective observational cohort study including a total of 335 CHD patients after successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) referred to the CR clinic in China between July 23, 2015 and March 1, 2018. Patients were assigned to two groups: HBCR tailored by monitoring and telecommunication via smartphone app (WeChat) (HBCR group, n = 170) or usual care (control group, n = 165), with follow-up for up to 42 months. Propensity score matching was conducted to match patients in the HBCR group with those in the control group. The patients in the HBCR group received educational materials weekly and individualized exercise prescription monthly, and the control group only received 20-min education at baseline in the CR clinic. The primary outcome was MACE, analyzed by Cox regression models. The changes in the secondary outcomes were analyzed by paired t-test among the matched cohort. Results: One hundred thirty-five HBCR patients were matched with the same number of control patients. Compared to the control group, the HBCR group had a much lower incidence of MACE (1.5 vs. 8.9%, p = 0.002), with adjusted HR = 0.21, 95% CI 0.07-0.85, and also had reduced unscheduled readmission (9.7 vs. 23.0%, p = 0.002), improved exercise capacity [maximal METs (6.2 vs. 5.1, p = 0.002)], higher Seattle Angina Questionnaire score, and better control of risk factors. Conclusions: The Chinese HBCR model using smartphone interaction is a safe and effective approach to decrease cardiovascular risks of patients with CHD and improve patients' wellness.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Many patients do not meet the recommended levels of physical activity after completing a cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program. Wearable activity trackers and mobile phone apps are promising potential self-management tools for maintaining physical activity after CR completion., OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the acceptability of a wearable device, mobile app, and push messages to facilitate physical activity following CR completion., METHODS: We used semistructured interviews to assess the acceptability of various mobile technologies after participation in a pilot randomized controlled trial. Intervention patients in the randomized controlled trial wore the Fitbit Charge 2, used the Movn mobile app, and received push messages on cardiovascular disease prevention and physical activity for over 2 months. We asked 26 intervention group participants for feedback about their experience with the technology and conducted semistructured individual interviews with 7 representative participants. We used thematic analysis to create the main themes from individual interviews., RESULTS: Our sample included participants with a mean age of 66.7 (SD 8.6) years; 23% (6/26) were female. Overall, there were varying levels of satisfaction with different technology components. There were 7 participants who completed the satisfaction questionnaires and participated in the interviews. The Fitbit and Movn mobile app received high satisfaction scores of 4.86 and 4.5, respectively, whereas push messages had a score of 3.14 out of 5. We identified four main themes through the interviews: technology use increased motivation to be physically active, technology use served as a reminder to be physically active, recommendations for technology to improve user experience, and desire for personal feedback., CONCLUSIONS: By applying a wearable activity tracker, mobile phone app, and push messages, our study showed strong potential for the adoption of new technologies by older adults to maintain physical activity after CR completion. Future research should include a larger sample over a longer period using a mixed methods approach to assess the efficacy of technology use for promoting long-term physical activity behavior in older adults.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is an evidence-based approach for preventing secondary cardiac events. Smartphone apps are starting to be used in CR to give patients real-time feedback on their health, connect them remotely with their medical team, and allow them to perform their rehabilitation at home. The use of smartphone apps is becoming omnipresent and has real potential in impacting patients in need of CR., OBJECTIVE: This paper provides critical examinations and summaries of existing research studies with an in-depth analysis of not only the individual studies but also the larger patterns that have emerged with smartphone apps in CR as well as their significance for practice change., METHODS: A systematic review was conducted through broad database searches that focused on evaluating randomized controlled trials, in compliance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) expectations. A total of 43 articles were evaluated, and 6 were chosen for this review. The dates of the articles ranged from 2014-2020, and the studies focused on the population of cardiac outpatients who needed CR after suffering a cardiac event, with interventions using a smartphone that incorporated the CR standards of the American Heart Association. The outcomes measured were directed at focusing on improved exercise function capacity, valued at a significance level of P<.05, for improved 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and peak oxygen uptake (PVO2) results., RESULTS: In the evaluated articles, the results were inconsistent for significant positive effects of CR smartphone apps on cardiac patients' physical function capacity in terms of the 6MWT and PVO2 when using a smartphone app to aid in CR., CONCLUSIONS: Because evidence in the literature suggests nonhomogeneous results for successful use of smartphone apps in CR, it is crucial to investigate the potential reasons for this inconsistency. An important observation from this systematic review is that smartphone apps used in CR have better clinical outcomes related to physical function capacity if the app automatically records information or provides real-time feedback to participants about their progress, compared to apps that only educate and encourage use while requiring the participant to manually log their CR activities. Additional factors to consider during these studies include the starting health of the patients, the sample sizes, and the specific components of CR that the smartphone apps are using. Overall, more clinical trials are needed that implement smartphone apps with these factors in mind, while placing stronger emphasis on using biosensing capabilities that can automatically log results and send them to providers on a real-time dashboard.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The world is currently undergoing a pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19). According to the World Health Organization, patients with chronic illnesses appear to be at the highest risk for COVID-19 associated sequelae. Inability to participate in outpatient-based rehabilitation programs and being home-bound can increase the risk for and potential worsening of chronic health conditions. This study evaluated the short-term effects of telerehabilitation on patients' walk test performance and health related quality of life (HRQoL)., METHODS: 47 patients (23 cardiovascular, 15 pulmonary, 9 oncology) participated in the telerehabilitation program. At baseline and following a 1-month intervention, patients had their 6-minute walk test distance (6MWTD) and HRQoL assessed. Average daily step counts were measured by the PACER App., CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that a short-term, supervised virtual telerehabilitation program had significant positive effects on 6MWTD and HRQoL in cardiac, pulmonary and oncology patients during COVID-19.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is an exercise-based program prescribed after cardiac events associated with improved physical, mental, and social functioning; however, many patients return to a sedentary lifestyle leading to deteriorating functional capacity after discharge from CR. Physical activity (PA) is critical to avoid recurrence of cardiac events and mortality and maintain functional capacity. Leveraging mobile health (mHealth) strategies to increase adherence to PA is a promising approach. Based on the social cognitive theory, we sought to determine whether mHealth strategies (Movn mobile app for self-monitoring, supportive push-through messages, and wearable activity tracker) would improve PA and functional capacity over 2 months., OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this pilot randomized controlled trial were to examine preliminary effects of an mHealth intervention on group differences in PA and functional capacity and group differences in depression and self-efficacy to maintain exercise after CR., METHODS: During the final week of outpatient CR, patients were randomized 1:1 to the intervention group or usual care. The intervention group downloaded the Movn mobile app, received supportive push-through messages on motivation and educational messages related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) management 3 times per week, and wore a Charge 2 (Fitbit Inc) activity tracker to track step counts. Participants in the usual care group wore a pedometer and recorded their daily steps in a diary. Data from the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and self-reported questionnaires were collected at baseline and 2 months., RESULTS: We recruited 60 patients from 2 CR sites at a community hospital in Northern California. The mean age was 68.0 (SD 9.3) years, and 23% (14/60) were female; retention rate was 85% (51/60). Our results from 51 patients who completed follow-up showed the intervention group had a statistically significant higher mean daily step count compared with the control (8860 vs 6633; P=.02). There was no difference between groups for the 6MWT, depression, or self-efficacy to maintain exercise., CONCLUSIONS: This intervention addresses a major public health initiative to examine the potential for mobile health strategies to promote PA in patients with CVD. Our technology-based pilot mHealth intervention provides promising results on a pragmatic and contemporary approach to promote PA by increasing daily step counts after completing CR., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03446313; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03446313.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac rehabilitation participants are encouraged to meet physical activity guidelines to reduce the risk of repeat cardiac events. However, previous studies have found that physical activity levels are low and sedentary behavior is high, both during and after cardiac rehabilitation. There is potential for smartphone apps to be effective in reducing sedentary behavior, although among the few studies that have investigated smartphone apps in cardiac rehabilitation, none targeted sedentary behavior., OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of a behavioral smartphone app (Vire) and a web-based behavior change program (ToDo-CR) to decrease sedentary behavior in cardiac rehabilitation participants., METHODS: Using a single-center, pre-post design, participants were recruited by nursing staff on admission to cardiac rehabilitation. All eligible participants installed the Vire app, were given a Fitbit Flex, and received the 6-week ToDo-CR program while attending cardiac rehabilitation. The ToDo-CR program uses personalized analytics to interpret important behavioral aspects (physical activity, variety, and social opportunity) and real-time information for generating and suggesting context-specific actionable microbehavioral alternatives (Do's). Do's were delivered via the app, with participants receiving 14 to 19 Do's during the 6-week intervention period. Outcome measures were collected at 0, 6, and 16 weeks. The assessors were not blinded. Feasibility outcomes included recruitment and follow-up rates, resource requirements, app usability (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 [UTAUT2] questionnaire), and objectively measured daily minutes of sedentary behavior (ActiGraph) for sample size estimation. Secondary outcomes included functional aerobic capacity (6-min walk test), quality of life (MacNew Heart Disease Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale questionnaire), BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and blood pressure., RESULTS: Between January and May 2019, 20 participants were recruited consecutively. One-third of people who commenced cardiac rehabilitation were eligible to participate. Other than declining to take part in the study (15/40, 38%), not having a smartphone was a major reason for exclusion (11/40, 28%). Those excluded without a smartphone were significantly older than participants with a smartphone (mean difference 20 [SD 5] years; P<.001). Participants were, on average, aged 54 (SD 13) years, mostly male (17/20, 85%), and working (12/20, 67%). At 6 weeks, 95% (19/20) of participants were assessed, and 60% (12/20) of participants were assessed at 16 weeks. Participants were relatively satisfied with the usability of the app (UTAUT2 questionnaire). Overall, participants spent 11 to 12 hours per day sitting. There was a medium effect size (Cohen d=0.54) for the reduction in sedentary behavior (minutes per day) over 16 weeks., CONCLUSIONS: The use of a behavioral smartphone app to decrease sitting time appears to be feasible in cardiac rehabilitation. A larger randomized controlled trial is warranted to determine the effectiveness of the app. Copyright ©Nicole Freene, Sander van Berlo, Margaret McManus, Tarryn Mair, Rachel Davey.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Home-based cardiac rehabilitations (CRs) with digital technologies have been researched and implemented to replace, augment, and complement traditional center-based CR in recent years with considerable success. One problem that technology-enhanced home-based CR can potentially address is the gap between cardiac interventions and formal CR programs. In the Netherlands and some other countries (eg, Australia), patients after cardiac interventions stay at home for 3-4 weeks without much support from their physicians, and often engage in very little physical activity (PA). A home-based exercise program enabled by digital technologies may help patients to better prepare for the later center-based CR programs, potentially increasing the uptake rate of those programs., OBJECTIVE: In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), we will evaluate the effectiveness of a home-based walking exercise program enhanced by self-tracking and mobile-based coaching (treatment condition), comparing it with a version of the same program without these technologies (control condition). The added value of the digital technologies is justified if patients in the treatment group walk more steps on average (primary outcome) and show better physical fitness in a bicycle ergometer test and higher self-efficacy toward PA (secondary outcomes)., METHODS: Based on a power analysis, we will recruit 100 cardiac patients and assign them evenly to the 2 parallel groups. Eligible patients are those who are scheduled in the postanesthesia care unit, know the Dutch language, have basic literacy of using smartphones, and are without medical conditions that may increase risks associated with PA. In a face-to-face meeting with a nurse practitioner, all patients are prescribed a 3-week exercise program at home (2 walking exercises per day with increasing duration), based on national and international guidelines and tailored to their physical conditions after cardiac intervention. Their physical activities (daily steps) will be measured by the Axivity AX3 accelerometer worn at hip position. Patients in the treatment group will also be supported by a Neo Health One self-tracking device and a mobile platform called Heart Angel, through which they are monitored and coached by their nurses. After the study, all patients will perform a bicycle ergometer test and return the devices within 1 week. In addition, 5 questionnaires will be sent to the patients by emails to assess their self-efficacy toward PA and other psychological states for exploratory analyses (at discharge, at the end of each monitoring week, and 1 week after the study). To minimize bias, the randomization procedure will be performed after introducing the exercise program, so the nurse practitioners are blind to the experimental conditions until that point., RESULTS: The study protocol has been approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committees United on February 26, 2018 (NL 62142.100.17/R17.51). By the end of 2018, we completed a small pilot study with 8 patients and the results based on interviews and app usage data suggest that a larger clinical trial with the targeted population is feasible. We expect to complete the RCT by the end of 2021, and statistical analyses will follow., CONCLUSIONS: Results of the RCT will help us to test the hypothesized benefits of self-tracking and mobile-based coaching for cardiac patients in home-based exercise programs during the discharge-rehabilitation gap.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death and disability among American women. The prevalence of CHD is expected to increase by more than 40% by 2035. In 2015, the estimated cost of caring for patients with CHD was US $182 billion in the United States; hospitalizations accounted for more than half of the costs. Compared with men, women with CHD or those who have undergone coronary revascularization have up to 30% more rehospitalizations within 30 days and up to 1 year. Center-based cardiac rehabilitation is the gold standard of care after an acute coronary event, but few women attend these valuable programs. Effective home-based interventions for improving cardiovascular health among women with CHD are vital for addressing this gap in care., OBJECTIVE: The ubiquity of mobile phones has made mobile health (mHealth) behavioral interventions a viable option to improve healthy behaviors of both women and men with CHD. First, this study aimed to examine the usability of a prototypic mHealth intervention designed specifically for women with CHD (herein referred to as HerBeat). Second, we examined the influence of HerBeat on selected health behaviors (self-efficacy for diet, exercise, and managing chronic illness) and psychological (perceived stress and depressive symptoms) characteristics of the participants., METHODS: Using a single-group, pretest, posttest design, 10 women participated in the 12-week usability study. Participants were provided a smartphone and a smartwatch on which the HerBeat app was installed. Using a web portal dashboard, a health coach monitored participants' ecological momentary assessment data, their behavioral data, and their heart rate and step count. Participants then completed a 12-week follow-up assessment., RESULTS: All 10 women (age: mean 64.4 years, SD 6.3 years) completed the study. The usability and acceptability of HerBeat were good, with a mean system usability score of 83.60 (SD 16.3). The participants demonstrated statistically significant improvements in waist circumference (P=.048), weight (P=.02), and BMI (P=.01). Furthermore, depressive symptoms, measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, significantly improved from baseline (P=.04)., CONCLUSIONS: The mHealth prototype was feasible and usable for women with CHD. Participants provided data that were useful for further development of HerBeat. The mHealth intervention is expected to help women with CHD self-manage their health behaviors. A randomized controlled trial is needed to further verify the findings. Copyright ©Avijit Sengupta, Theresa Beckie, Kaushik Dutta, Arup Dey, Sriram Chellappan.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Physical activity behavior change is considered one of the most challenging lifestyle modifications in patients with heart failure. Even after participation in a cardiac rehabilitation program, most patients do not engage in the recommended level of physical activity., OBJECTIVE: To determine which baseline demographic, physical activity levels, psychological distress, and clinical variables predicted physical activity behavior change to increasing light-to-vigorous physical activity by 10,000 steps/day following participation in home-based cardiac rehabilitation intervention., METHODS: A prospective design involving secondary analysis was used to analyze data obtained from 127 patients (mean, 61; range, 45-69 years) enrolled in and completed an 8-week home-based mobile health app intervention. The intervention was designed to encourage health behavior change with regard to decreasing sedentary behavior and increasing physical activities performed at light or greater intensities., RESULTS: None of the participants accumulated 10,000 steps or more per day pre-intervention (mean, 1549; range, 318-4915 steps/day). Only 55 participants (43%) achieved an average daily step count of 10,000 or more at week 8 of the intervention (10,674 +/- 263). The results of the logistic regression showed that higher pre-intervention physical activity levels and anxiety symptoms and lower depressive symptoms were associated with a higher likelihood of achieving physical activity behavior change (p < .003)., CONCLUSION: These data highlight that determining pre-intervention physical activity levels and depressive symptoms can be the key to designing an effective home-based cardiac rehabilitation intervention in patients with heart failure.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) cause most deaths globally and can reduce quality of life (QoL) of rehabilitees with cardiac disease. The risk factors of CVDs are physical inactivity and increased BMI. With physical activity, it is possible to prevent CVDs, improve QoL, and help maintain a healthy body mass. Current literature shows the possibilities of digitalization and advanced technology in supporting independent self-rehabilitation. However, the interpretation of the results is complicated owing to the studies' high heterogeneity. In addition, the added value of this technology has not been studied well, especially in cardiac rehabilitation., OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the effectiveness of added remote technology in cardiac rehabilitation on physical function, anthropometrics, and QoL in rehabilitees with CVD compared with conventional rehabilitation., METHODS: Rehabilitees were cluster randomized into 3 remote technology intervention groups (n=29) and 3 reference groups (n=30). The reference group received conventional cardiac rehabilitation, and the remote technology intervention group received conventional cardiac rehabilitation with added remote technology, namely, the Movendos mCoach app and Fitbit charge accelerometer. The 12 months of rehabilitation consisted of three 5-day in-rehabilitation periods in the rehabilitation center. Between these periods were two 6-month self-rehabilitation periods. Outcome measurements included the 6-minute walk test, body mass, BMI, waist circumference, and World Health Organization QoL-BREF questionnaire at baseline and at 6 and 12 months. Between-group differences were assessed using 2-tailed t tests and Mann-Whitney U test. Within-group differences were analyzed using a paired samples t test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test., RESULTS: Overall, 59 rehabilitees aged 41 to 66 years (mean age 60, SD 6 years; n=48, 81% men) were included in the study. Decrement in waist circumference (6 months: 1.6 cm; P=.04; 12 months: 3 cm; P<.001) and increment in self-assessed QoL were greater (environmental factors: 0.5; P=.02) in the remote technology intervention group than the reference group. Both groups achieved statistically significant improvements in the 6-minute walk test in both time frames (P=.01-.03). Additionally, the remote technology intervention group achieved statistically significant changes in the environmental domain at 0-6 months (P=.03) and waist circumference at both time frames (P=.01), and reference group achieve statistically significant changes in waist circumference at 0-6 months (P=.02)., CONCLUSIONS: Remote cardiac rehabilitation added value to conventional cardiac rehabilitation in terms of waist circumference and QoL. The results were clinically small, but the findings suggest that adding remote technology to cardiac rehabilitation may increase beneficial health outcomes. There was some level of systematic error during rehabilitation intervention, and the sample size was relatively small. Therefore, care must be taken when generalizing the study results beyond the target population. To confirm assumptions of the added value of remote technology in rehabilitation interventions, more studies involving different rehabilitees with cardiac disease are required., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN Registry ISRCTN61225589; https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN61225589.

N2  - AIM: To describe the development of a mobile health application -mICardiApp- designed by a multidisciplinary professional team and patients with heart failure and to evaluate its content validity., METHODS: Critical reviews of the literature, semi-structured interviews with patients, and user stories guided the development of the content of the mobile application. These contents were refined and validated through a modified Delphi process. An expert panel of healthcare and social care professionals together with patients and academics evaluated the content through two content validity indicators, relevance, and adequacy, and provided narrative feedback. The content validity of the app and each screen was determined by calculating the Content Validity Index (CVI). Similarly, the Adequacy Index (AI) was analyzed., RESULTS: The developed app is composed by 8 topics: (1) available resources, (2) cardiac rehabilitation, (3) control of signs and symptoms, (4) emotional support, (5) learning and having fun, (6) medication, (7) nutrition, and (8) physical activity. The results demonstrated high CVI of the screens and the full app. 57 of the 59 screens in the app reached an excellent CVI >= 0.70 for both relevance and adequacy, except for 2 screens. The CVI Average Method of the app was 0.851., CONCLUSIONS: mICardiApp is presented as an application to improve health literacy and self-management of patients with multimorbidity and heart failure, with proven validation.

N2  - Objective: Consumer wearable devices allow physical activity to be measured objectively, which can be useful in remote cardiovascular disease management. This review aimed to summarize the effects of using wearable devices to monitor physical activity/adherence to physical activity in adults with cardiovascular disease. Methods: The review used The Cochrane Overview of Reviews Methodology. The databases searched were PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the date of the last search was October 12, 2021. Risk of bias was assessed using the AMSTAR-2 R tool. Results: Of the 767 records, we identified 6 systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MA) that met our inclusion criteria. The individual SRs did not consistently favor the use of wearables, but the MA syntheses each found significant effects, favoring wearable devices in measures, including mean steps per day and mean time spent completing moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. The MA on adherence to cardiac rehabilitation (CR) found greater adherence to CR with the use of a mobile app than with no app support. Summary: Within this review, there were SRs demonstrating no difference and reviews indicating a positive impact with the use of wearables for physical activity/adherence measures in individuals with cardiovascular conditions, with no studies demonstrating a negative impact. The six SR/MAs included had methodological flaws, which introduced potential biases. Additionally, the MAs included a small number of studies, which limits their generalizability. The protocol for this review was registered on PROSPERO, the international prospective register of systematic reviews (#CRD42021286699).

N2  - Women are underrepresented in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) despite the benefits, and this is exacerbated in lower-resource settings where CR is insufficiently available. In this randomized controlled trial, the effectiveness of the Technology-based Comprehensive Cardiac Rehabilitation Therapy (TaCT) electronic cardiac rehabilitation (eCR) intervention on functional capacity, risk factors, quality of life, heart-health behaviors, symptoms, and morbidity will be tested among women with CVD in a middle-income country. Following a pilot study, a single-center, single-blinded, 2 parallel-arm (1:1 SNOSE) superiority trial comparing an eCR intervention (TaCT) to usual care, with assessments pre-intervention and at 3 and 6 months will be undertaken. One hundred adult women will be recruited. Permuted block (size 10) randomization will be applied. The 6-month intervention comprises an app, website, SMS texts with generic heart-health management advice, and bi-weekly 1:1 telephone calls with a nurse trainee. Individualized exercise prescriptions will be developed based on an Incremental Shuttle Walk Test (primary outcome) and dietary plans based on 24 h dietary recall. A yoga/relaxation video will be provided via WhatsApp, along with tobacco cessation support and a moderated group chat. At 3 months, intervention engagement and acceptability will be assessed. Analyses will be conducted based on intent-to-treat. If results of this novel trial of women-focused eCR in a middle-income country demonstrate clinically-significant increases in functional capacity, this could represent an important development for the field considering this would be an important outcome for women and would translate to lower mortality.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease is the main cause of death and loss of disability-adjusted life years worldwide. Information and communication technology has become an important part of health care systems, including the innovative cardiac rehabilitation services through mobile phone and mobile health (mHealth) interventions., OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to determine the effectiveness of different kinds of mHealth programs in changing lifestyle behavior, promoting adherence to treatment, and controlling modifiable cardiovascular risk factors and psychosocial outcomes in patients who have experienced a coronary event., METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. A thorough search of the following biomedical databases was conducted: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, SciELO, CINAHL, Scopus, The Clinical Trial, and Cochrane. Articles that were randomized clinical trials that involved an intervention consisting of an mHealth program using a mobile app in patients after a coronary event were included. The articles analyzed some of the following variables as outcome variables: changes in lifestyle behavior, cardiovascular risk factors, and anthropometric and psychosocial variables. A meta-analysis of the variables studied was performed with the Cochrane tool. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool; the quality of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation tool; and heterogeneity was measured using the I2 test., RESULTS: A total of 23 articles were included in the review, and 20 (87%) were included in the meta-analysis, with a total sample size of 4535 patients. Exercise capacity measured using the 6-minute walk test (mean difference=21.64, 95% CI 12.72-30.55; P<.001), physical activity (standardized mean difference [SMD]=0.42, 95% CI 0.04-0.81; P=.03), and adherence to treatment (risk difference=0.19, 95% CI 0.11-0.28; P<.001) were significantly superior in the mHealth group. Furthermore, both the physical and mental dimensions of quality of life were better in the mHealth group (SMD=0.26, 95% CI 0.09-0.44; P=.004 and SMD=0.27, 95% CI 0.06-0.47; P=.01, respectively). In addition, hospital readmissions for all causes and cardiovascular causes were statistically higher in the control group than in the mHealth group (SMD=-0.03, 95% CI -0.05 to -0.00; P=.04 vs SMD=-0.04, 95% CI -0.07 to -0.00; P=.05)., CONCLUSIONS: mHealth technology has a positive effect on patients who have experienced a coronary event in terms of their exercise capacity, physical activity, adherence to medication, and physical and mental quality of life, as well as readmissions for all causes and cardiovascular causes., TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) CRD42022299931; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=299931.

N2  - The development and course of heart disease can be decisively influenced by psychological comorbidities (especially depression, anxiety disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder). An acute or chronic cardiological disease can in turn trigger or exacerbate mental disorders. These relationships are of considerable importance for cardiac rehabilitation, since psychological comorbidities often limit activity and participation more than organic heart disease. In monodisciplinary rehabilitation procedures (cardiological or psychosomatic), however, in the case of comorbidity, one clinical picture cannot be adequately treated and assessed by socio-medical experts. Interdisciplinary rehabilitation concepts are required here. In the first part of this article, the development and implementation of an interdisciplinary psychocardiological rehabilitation concept from the model phase to the establishment and expansion to other disciplines as well as the first research results are described. After initial positive evaluation data and good acceptance by the rehabilitants, the German Pension Insurance (DRV) is expanding the concept to other specialist areas under the name "dual rehabilitation" in order to promote interdisciplinary cooperation in the case of psychological and somatic comorbidity. In the second part of the work, the concept and first data from the controlled EvaPK study (Evaluation of the effectiveness of psychocardiological rehabilitation) funded by the DRV Bund are presented. These show that the comorbid patients are particularly stressed in terms of activity and participation (recorded in the Mini-ICF-APP-S) and that psychocardiological rehabilitation is also effective in this highly stressed group. However, the evaluations of the catamnesis and the cardiac function parameters are still missing. Both the pilot study and the first data from the EvaPK study show that psychocardiological rehabilitation meets the needs of comorbid patients and is well accepted by them. However, successful psychocardiological rehabilitation according to the concept presented here requires higher personnel costs and intensive, equal cooperation. Further research on this is necessary.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Treatment of acute myocardial infarction has been the subject of studies over the past years. However, the initial months after myocardial infarction are crucial from the perspective of the patient's prognosis. It is extremely important to take care of all cardiovascular risk factors and undergo a full rehabilitation program. Telemedical solutions are becoming more and more relevant in everyday practice. We describe a protocol of a study evaluating the use of the mobile application "afterAMI" in patients after myocardial infarction. The app offers an educational mode, calendar, vital signs diary, medication reminders, medical history card, and healthcare professional contact panel. It offers several solutions, which individually proved to be effective and improve a patient's prognosis. Despite general promising results from previous studies regarding telemedical tools, there is a paucity of evidence when it comes to prospective randomized trials. Our aim was to perform a comprehensive evaluation of a newly developed mobile application in the clinical setting., METHODS: A group of 100 patients with myocardial infarction on admission at the 1st Chair and Department of Cardiology, Medical University of Warsaw, will be recruited into the study. The project aims to assess the impact of the application-supported model of care in comparison with standard rehabilitation. At the end of the study, cardiovascular risk factors will be analyzed, along with rehospitalizations, the patients' knowledge regarding cardiovascular risk factors, returning to work, and quality of life. In this prospective, open-label, randomized, single-center study, all 100 patients will be observed for 6 months after discharge from the hospital. Endpoints will be assessed during control visits 1 and 6 months after inclusion into the study., DISCUSSION: This project is an example of a telemedical solution application embracing everyday clinical practices, conforming with multiple international cardiac societies' guidelines. Cardiac rehabilitation process enhancements are required to improve patients' prognosis. The evidence regarding the use of the mobile application in the described group of patients is limited and usually covers a small number of participants. The described study aims to discuss whether telemedicine use in this context is beneficial for the patients., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04793425 . Registered on 11 March 2021.

N2  - PURPOSE: This study systematically evaluated the quality and functionalities of patient-facing, commercially available mobile health (mHealth) apps for cardiac rehabilitation (CR)., METHODS: We performed our search in two of the most widely used commercial mobile app stores: Apple iTunes Appstore and Google Play Store (Android apps). Six search terms were used to query relevant CR apps: "cardiac rehabilitation," "heart disease and remote therapy," "heart failure exercise," "heart therapy and cardiac recovery," "cardiac recovery," and "heart therapy." App quality was evaluated using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS). App functionality was evaluated using the IQVIA functionality scale, and app content was evaluated against the American Heart Association guidelines for CR. Apps meeting our inclusion criteria were downloaded and evaluated by two to three reviewers, and interclass correlations between reviewers were calculated., RESULTS: We reviewed 3121 apps and nine apps met our inclusion criteria. On average, the apps scored a 3.0 on the MARS (5-point Likert scale) for overall quality. The two top-ranking mHealth apps for CR for all three quality, functionality, and consistency with evidence-based guidelines were My Cardiac Coach and Love My Heart for Women, both of which scored >=4.0 for behavior change., CONCLUSION: Overall, the quality and functionality of free apps for mobile CR was high, with two apps performing the best across all three quality categories. High-quality CR apps are available that can expand access to CR for patients with cardiovascular disease. Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Patients hospitalized with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or heart failure (HF) are frequently readmitted. This is the first randomized controlled trial of a mobile health intervention that combines telemonitoring and education for inpatients with ACS or HF to prevent readmission., OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the feasibility, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of a smartphone app-based model of care (TeleClinical Care [TCC]) in patients discharged after ACS or HF admission., METHODS: In this pilot, 2-center randomized controlled trial, TCC was applied at discharge along with usual care to intervention arm participants. Control arm participants received usual care alone. Inclusion criteria were current admission with ACS or HF, ownership of a compatible smartphone, age >=18 years, and provision of informed consent. The primary end point was the incidence of unplanned 30-day readmissions. Secondary end points included all-cause readmissions, cardiac readmissions, cardiac rehabilitation completion, medication adherence, cost-effectiveness, and user satisfaction. Intervention arm participants received the app and Bluetooth-enabled devices for measuring weight, blood pressure, and physical activity daily plus usual care. The devices automatically transmitted recordings to the patients' smartphones and a central server. Thresholds for blood pressure, heart rate, and weight were determined by the treating cardiologists. Readings outside these thresholds were flagged to a monitoring team, who discussed salient abnormalities with the patients' usual care providers (cardiologists, general practitioners, or HF outreach nurses), who were responsible for further management. The app also provided educational push notifications. Participants were followed up after 6 months., RESULTS: Overall, 164 inpatients were randomized (TCC: 81/164, 49.4%; control: 83/164, 50.6%; mean age 61.5, SD 12.3 years; 130/164, 79.3% men; 128/164, 78% admitted with ACS). There were 11 unplanned 30-day readmissions in both groups (P=.97). Over a mean follow-up of 193 days, the intervention was associated with a significant reduction in unplanned hospital readmissions (21 in TCC vs 41 in the control arm; P=.02), including cardiac readmissions (11 in TCC vs 25 in the control arm; P=.03), and higher rates of cardiac rehabilitation completion (20/51, 39% vs 9/49, 18%; P=.03) and medication adherence (57/76, 75% vs 37/74, 50%; P=.002). The average usability rating for the app was 4.5/5. The intervention cost Aus $6028 (US $4342.26) per cardiac readmission saved. When modeled in a mainstream clinical setting, enrollment of 237 patients was projected to have the same expenditure compared with usual care, and enrollment of 500 patients was projected to save approximately Aus $100,000 (approximately US $70,000) annually., CONCLUSIONS: TCC was feasible and safe for inpatients with either ACS or HF. The incidence of 30-day readmissions was similar; however, long-term benefits were demonstrated, including fewer readmissions over 6 months, improved medication adherence, and improved cardiac rehabilitation completion., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12618001547235; https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=375945.

N2  - BACKGROUND: To improve cardiovascular risk factors modification and effects of cardiac rehabilitation (CR), electronic applications on CR are suggested in the literature for patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)., METHODS: A sequential qualitative study, embedded in a quantitative experimental trial for mHealth application on CR (mCR) study evaluation, was conducted to understand the usability and satisfaction of mCR study. Purposive sampling were used until achieving data saturation. Individually semi-structured interviews were conducted. The textual narration from interview transcriptions were analysed by content analysis., RESULTS: Ten participants were interviewed for qualitative evaluation. Findings presented the perceptive and experience of the mCR app users. Results were captured by four themes: 1. feasibility of mCR app, including practicality, acceptability and convenience, and barriers to use; 2. benefits from mCR app, explaining the effectiveness of mCR study; 3. advocator for better hospital care, disclosing an extension of healthcare and promoting patient-healthcarer relationship; and 4. recommendation for mCR app improvement., CONCLUSION: Findings provided insights for cardiac healthcare providers to understand the feasibility of mHealth application on phase II CR in Macau. The mCR app facilitated CR engagement which contributed to health and well-being by promoting CHD and CR knowledge, and cardiac healthy lifestyle modification.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The interval between inpatient hospitalization for symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD) and post-discharge office consultation is a vulnerable period for adverse events., METHODS: Content was customized on a smartphone app-based platform for hospitalized patients receiving percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) which included education, tracking, reminders and live health coaches. We conducted a single-arm open-label pilot study of the app at two academic medical centers in a single health system, with subjects enrolled 02/2018-05/2019 and 1:3 propensity-matched historical controls from 01/2015-12/2017. To evaluate feasibility and efficacy, we assessed 30-day hospital readmission (primary), outpatient cardiovascular follow-up, and cardiac rehabilitation (CR) enrollment as recorded in the health system. Outcomes were assessed by Cox Proportional Hazards model., FINDINGS: 118 of 324 eligible (36.4%) 21-85 year-old patients who underwent PCI for symptomatic CAD who owned a smartphone or tablet enrolled. Mean age was 62.5 (9.7) years, 87 (73.7%) were male, 40 of 118 (33.9%) had type 2 diabetes mellitus, 68 (57.6%) enrolled underwent PCI for MI and 59 (50.0%) had previously known CAD; demographics were similar among matched historical controls. No significant difference existed in all-cause readmission within 30 days (8.5% app vs 9.6% control, ARR -1.1% absolute difference, 95% CI -7.1-4.8, p = 0.699) or 90 days (16.1% app vs 19.5% control, p = 0.394). Rates of both 90-day CR enrollment (HR 1.99, 95% CI 1.30-3.06) and 1-month cardiovascular follow up (HR 1.83, 95% CI 1.43-2.34) were greater with the app. Weekly engagement at 30- and 90-days, as measured by percentage of weeks with at least one day of completion of tasks, was mean (SD) 73.5% (33.9%) and 63.5% (40.3%). Spearman correlation analyses indicated similar engagement across age, sex, and cardiovascular risk factors., INTERPRETATIONS: A post-PCI smartphone app with live health coaches yielded similarly high engagement across demographics and safely increased attendance in cardiac rehabilitation. Larger prospective randomized controlled trials are necessary to test whether this app improves cardiovascular outcomes following PCI., FUNDING: National Institutes of Health, Boston Scientific., CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT03416920 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03416920).

N2  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia after cardiac surgery, yet the precise incidence and significance of arrhythmias after discharge home need to be better defined. Photoplethysmography (PPG)-based smartphone apps are promising tools to enable early detection and follow-up of arrhythmias., OBJECTIVE: By using a PPG-based smartphone app, we aimed to gain more insight into the prevalence of AF and other rhythm-related complications upon discharge home after cardiac surgery and evaluate the implementation of this app into routine clinical care., METHODS: In this prospective, single-center trial, patients recovering from cardiac surgery were asked to register their heart rhythm 3 times daily using a Food and Drug Administration-approved PPG-based app, for either 30 or 60 days after discharge home. Patients with permanent AF or a permanent pacemaker were excluded., RESULTS: We included 24 patients (mean age 60.2 years, SD 12 years; 15/23, 65% male) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and/or valve surgery. During hospitalization, 39% (9/23) experienced postoperative AF. After discharge, the PPG app reported AF or atrial flutter in 5 patients. While the app notified flutter in 1 patient, this was a false positive, as electrocardiogram revealed a 2nd-degree, 2:1 atrioventricular block necessitating a permanent pacemaker. AF was confirmed in 4 patients (4/23, 17%) and interestingly, was associated with an underlying postoperative complication in 2 participants (pneumonia n=1, pericardial tamponade n=1). A significant increase in the proportion of measurements indicating sinus rhythm was observed when comparing the first to the second month of follow-up (P<.001). In the second month of follow-up, compliance was significantly lower with 2.2 (SD 0.7) measurements per day versus 3.0 (SD 0.8) measurements per day in the first month (P=.002). The majority of participants (17/23, 74%), as well as the surveyed primary care physicians, experienced positive value by using the app as they felt more involved in the postoperative rehabilitation., CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of smartphone-based PPG technology enables detection of AF and other rhythm-related complications after cardiac surgery. An association between AF detection and an underlying complication was found in 2 patients. Therefore, smartphone-based PPG technology may supplement rehabilitation after cardiac surgery by acting as a sentinel for underlying complications, rhythm-related or otherwise.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is recommended for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease and reducing the risk of repeat cardiac events. Physical activity is a core component of CR; however, studies show that participants remain largely sedentary. Sedentary behaviour is an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality. Strategies to encourage sedentary behaviour change are needed. This study will explore the effectiveness and costs of a smartphone application (Vire) and an individualised online behaviour change program (ToDo-CR) in reducing sedentary behaviour, all-cause hospital admissions and emergency department visits over 12 months after commencing CR., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A multicentre, assessor-blind parallel randomised controlled trial will be conducted with 144 participants (18+ years). Participants will be recruited from three phase-II CR centres. They will be assessed on admission to CR and randomly assigned (1:1) to one of two groups: CR plus the ToDo-CR 6-month programme or usual care CR. Both groups will be re-assessed at 6 months and 12 months for the primary outcome of all-cause hospital admissions and presentations to the emergency department. Accelerometer-measured changes in sedentary behaviour and physical activity will also be assessed. Logistic regression models will be used for the primary outcome of hospital admissions and emergency department visits. Methods for repeated measures analysis will be used for all other outcomes. A cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted to evaluate the effects of the intervention on the rates of hospital admissions and emergency department visits within the 12 months post commencing CR., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study received ethical approval from the Australian Capital Territory Health (2019.ETH.00162), Calvary Public Hospital Bruce (20-2019) and the University of Canberra (HREC-2325) Human Research Ethics Committees (HREC). Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed academic journals. Results will be made available to participants on request., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN12619001223123.

N2  - Children and adolescents with congenital heart disease often do not have the opportunity, inclination, or education to participate in safe and effective exercise. The consequences of this behavioral pattern affect not only cardiopulmonary parameters, but also psychosocial factors, especially when lack of participation in peer activities or sports leads to isolation and further sedentary behaviors. Importantly, unlike cardiac rehabilitation programs for adults with atherosclerotic disease, the goal for congenital heart disease patients was less about "rehabilitation" and more about promotion of optimal fitness. We thus developed a comprehensive "Cardiac Fitness Program" at Boston Children's Hospital to promote exercise training, enhanced self-confidence, and motivation for patients with congenital heart disease. Since much of sustained fitness relates to consistency and behavior change, we crafted a progressive, goal-oriented exercise curriculum and augmented it with a self-learning workbook of targeted positive mindset practices to develop self-efficacy, an app for motivation and data collection, and exercise videos to demonstrate mechanics and to reiterate a positive message. We now report our experience including program structure and framework, navigating insurance, curriculum development, and outcome measures. Methods employed and barriers encountered in the initial development and execution of this program are reviewed. Key take-aways and further considerations including virtual and home-based programs are discussed.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Mobile health interventions, especially smartphone applications (apps), have been proposed as promising interventions for supporting adherence to healthy behaviour in patients post cardiac rehabilitation (CR). The overall aim of the study was to examine the effect of individualized follow-up with an app for one year on peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) in patients completing CR., DESIGN: The study was designed as a single-blinded multicentre randomized controlled trial., METHODS: The intervention group (IG) received individualized follow-up enabled with an app for one year, while the control group (CG) received usual care. The primary outcome was difference in VO2peak. Secondary outcomes included exercise performance (time to exhaustion, peak incline (%) and peak velocity (km/h)), bodyweight, resting blood pressure, lipid profile, triglycerides, exercise habits, health-related quality of life, health status and self-perceived goal achievement., RESULTS: In total, 113 patients completing CR (73.4% with coronary artery disease, 16.8% after valve surgery and 9.8% with other heart diseases) were randomly allocated to the IG or CG. Intention to treat analyses showed a statistically significant difference in VO2peak between the groups at follow-up of 2.2 ml/kg/min, 95% confidence interval 0.9-3.5 (p < 0.001). Statistically significant differences were also observed in exercise performance, exercise habits and in self-perceived goal achievement., CONCLUSIONS: Individualized follow-up for one year with an app significantly improved VO2peak, exercise performance and exercise habits, as well as self-perceived goal achievement, compared with a CG in patients post-CR. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups at follow-up in the other outcome measures evaluated.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs addressing risk factor management, educational interventions, and exercise contribute to reduce mortality after myocardial infarction (MI). However, the fulfillment of guideline-recommended CR targets is currently unsatisfactory. eHealth, i.e., the use of electronic communication for healthcare, including the use of mobile smartphone applications combined with different sensors and interactive computerized programs, offers a new array of possibilities to provide clinical care. The present study aims to assess the efficacy of a web-based application (app) designed to support persons in adhering to lifestyle advice and medication as a complement to traditional CR programs for improvement of risk factors and clinical outcomes in patients with MI compared with usual care., METHODS/DESIGN: An open-label multi-center randomized controlled trial is being conducted at different CR centers from three Swedish University Hospitals. The aim is to include 150 patients with MI < 75 years of age who are confident smartphone and/or Internet users. In addition to participation in CR programs according to the usual routine at each center, patients randomized to the intervention arm will receive access to the web-based app. A CR nurse reviews the patients' self-reported data twice weekly through a medical interface at the clinic. The primary outcome of the study will be change in submaximal exercise capacity (in watts) between 2 and 4 weeks after discharge and when the patient has completed his/her exercise program at the CR center, usually around 3-6 months post-discharge. Secondary outcomes include changes in self-reported physical activity, objectively assessed physical activity by accelerometry, self-rated health, dietary, and smoking habits, body mass index, blood pressure, blood lipids, and glucose/HbA1c levels between inclusion and follow-up visits during the first year post-MI. Additionally, we will assess uptake and adherence to the application, the number of CR staff contacts, and the incidence of cardiovascular events at 1 and 3 years after the MI. Patient recruitment started in 2016, and the first study results are expected in the beginning of 2019., DISCUSSION: The present study will add evidence to whether electronic communication can be used to improve traditional CR programs for patients after MI., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03260582 .

N2  - Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is recommended for patients with coronary heart disease, however, participation among veterans remains poor. Smartphones may facilitate data transfer and communication between patients and providers, among other benefits. We evaluated the feasibility of a smartphone-enabled CR program in a population of veterans. Qualifying veterans were prospectively enrolled in a single-arm, nonrandomized feasibility study of a smartphone-enabled, home-based CR program, featuring an app with daily reminders to exercise, log vitals, and review educational materials. A coach remotely monitored patients through an online dashboard and scheduled telephone visits. Clinical end points were assessed as an exploratory aim. After 21 veterans provided informed consent, 18 were enrolled and successfully completed at least 30days of the program; 13 completed the entire 12-week intervention. Mean (standard deviation) age was 62 (7) years and 96% were male. Program completers logged a mean (standard deviation) of 3.5 (1.4) exercise sessions and 150 (86) exercise minutes per week. The majority (84%) of program completers reported being satisfied overall with the program. Mean functional capacity improved by 1.0 metabolic equivalents (5.3 to 6.3, 95% confidence interval 0.3 to 1.7; p=0.008) and mean systolic blood pressure at rest improved by 9.6mm Hg (mean difference 9.6, 95% confidence interval -19.0 to -0.7; p=0.049) among completers. Smartphone-enabled, home-based CR is feasible in veterans with heart disease and is associated with moderate to high levels of engagement and patient satisfaction. Copyright © 2018.

N2  - A pilot study was conducted to determine if a smartphone-based adjunct to standard care could increase the completion rate of a cardiac rehabilitation program (CRP). Based on historical completion rates, 66 participants who were about to commence a hospital-based CRP were randomized so that half received three devices embedded with near-field communication, namely, a smartphone [pre-installed with an application (app) designed specifically for cardiac rehabilitation], portable blood pressure monitor, and weight scale while completing the CRP. The completion rate among participants who were randomized to the intervention group was 88%, compared to 67% in the control group ( = 0.038). This combined with the week-to-week frequency with which participants in the intervention group measured their blood pressure ( 5/week) demonstrated the ability of the intervention to increase the proportion of patients who completed the CRP. No significant differences were found between the treatment groups for the measurements taken at baseline and prior to discharge from the CRP. A statistically significant correlation ( = 0.472; = 0.013) was found between the average time participants walked each day (as estimated via the smartphone app) and participants' six minute walking distance (6MWD) before they were discharged from the CRP (a clinically validated measurement).

N2  - Background Mobile technologies are innovative, scalable approaches to reducing risk of cardiovascular disease but evidence related to effectiveness and acceptability remains limited. We aimed to explore the effectiveness, acceptability and usefulness of mobile applications (apps) for cardiovascular disease self-management and risk factor control. Design Systematic review with meta-synthesis of quantitative and qualitative data. Methods Comprehensive search of multiple databases (Medline, Embase, CINAHL, SCOPUS and Cochrane CENTRAL) and grey literature. Studies were included if the intervention was primarily an app aimed at improving at least two lifestyle behaviours in adults with cardiovascular disease. Meta-synthesis of quantitative and qualitative data was performed to review and evaluate findings. Results Ten studies of varying designs including 607 patients from five countries were included. Interventions targeted hypertension, heart failure, stroke and cardiac rehabilitation populations. Factors that improved among app users were rehospitalisation rates, disease-specific knowledge, quality of life, psychosocial well-being, blood pressure, body mass index, waist circumference, cholesterol and exercise capacity. Improved physical activity, medication adherence and smoking cessation were also characteristic of app users. Appealing app features included tracking healthy behaviours, self-monitoring, disease education and personalised, customisable content. Small samples, short duration and selection bias were noted limitations across some studies, as was the relatively low overall scientific quality of evidence. Conclusions Multiple behaviours and cardiovascular disease risk factors appear modifiable in the shorter term with use of mobile apps. Evidence for effectiveness requires larger, controlled studies of longer duration, with emphasis on process evaluation data to better understand important system- and patient-level characteristics.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Long-term maintenance of preventive activities is fundamental for achieving improved outcomes in cardiac rehabilitation (CR). Despite this, it has been shown to be a major challenge for many patients to follow recommendations and thereby adhere to a heart-healthy lifestyle. Mobile phone apps have been emphasized as potential tools to promote preventive activities after attendance in a CR program. Before commencing a trial to assess the potential effect of using an app to promote long-term adherence to preventive activities after attendance in CR, a study to assess if it is feasible to use an app is warranted., OBJECTIVE: The goal of the research is to assess if it is feasible to use a mobile phone app for promoting and monitoring patients' adherence to a heart-healthy lifestyle after CR., METHODS: The study included an experimental, pre-post single-arm trial lasting for 12 weeks. All patients received access to an app aimed to guide individuals to change or maintain a heart-healthy lifestyle. During the study period, patients received weekly, individualized monitoring through the app, based on their own goals. Feasibility outcomes assessed were recruitment rate, adherence to the app, resource requirements, and efficacy regarding capability to detect a change in quality of life, health status, and perceived goal achievement as well as evaluating ceiling and floor effect in these outcomes. Criteria for success were preset to be able to evaluate whether the app was feasible to use in a potential future RCT., RESULTS: In total, 71% (17/24) of the patients who completed CR were eligible for a potential RCT as well as for this study. All 14 patients included in the study used the app to promote preventive activities throughout the study. Satisfaction with the technology was high, and the patients found the technology-based follow-up intervention both useful and motivational. Ceiling effect was present in more than 20% of the patients in several domains of the questionnaires evaluating quality of life (36-Item Short Form Health Survey and COOP/WONCA functional health assessments) and health status (EQ-5D). Overall self-rated health status (EuroQol Visual Analog Scale) and perceived goal achievement were found to be outcomes able to detect a change., CONCLUSIONS: Individual follow-up through an app after attendance in CR is feasible. All patients used the app for preventive activities and found the app both useful and motivating. Several points of guidance from the patients in the study have been adopted and incorporated into the final design of the RCT now in the field.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs are evidence-based and widely recommended. However, benefits from CR are likely lost among individuals who discontinue their regular exercise routines and healthy habits. One possible approach to enhance adherence to lifestyle advice after completion of CR, may be individualized follow-up enabled by a smartphone application (app)., METHODS: A protocol of a single-blinded, pragmatic randomized controlled trial. The study will take place in the eastern part of Norway, and will include heart patients who have completed CR. Participants will be recruited from two CR centers. Based on power calculation, 113 participants will be included. The intervention group will receive individualized follow-up through an app on a weekly basis throughout a year. The app will be set up with the participant's own goals, and the follow-up will be based on these individual goals. The control group will receive usual care, including general advice regarding physical activity, exercise and diet. The participants will be assessed at baseline (at completion of CR) and 12 months after baseline. Primary outcome of the study will be peak oxygen uptake. Secondary outcomes include exercise performance, quality of life, health status, health literacy, self-perceived goal achievement, exercise habits, body weight, blood pressure as well as lipids and triglycerides., DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this will be the first study to examine the effects of individualized follow-up with an app for one year, in patients completing CR. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that the study may be groundbreaking. Due to the large sample size and the theoretically based intervention, the study has the potential to generate new knowledge that may improve the design of future technology-based follow-up interventions of patients that have completed rehabilitation., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The MedFit app is designed to facilitate participation of people with cardiovascular disease (CVD) in an exercise-based rehabilitation program remotely. This paper details the development for the MedFit app., OBJECTIVE: The aim of this research was to develop a behavior change, theoretically informed exercise rehabilitation mobile app for adults with CVD by following the early stages of the formative research: development and feasibility testing., METHODS: Adhering to the mobile health (mHealth) development evaluation framework, the stages of the formative research process including (1) development and (2) feasibility were undertaken. The content and format of the MedFit app were developed based on (1) theory, (2) usability testing, and (3) content design., RESULTS: A systematic review of the literature was undertaken to identify the most appropriate theories from which to develop the app. This led to the creation of the MedFit app. The app went through iterative rounds of usability focus group testing with adults with CVD to provide feedback on the app. This process was framed by the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model. Feedback was then translated into feasible technical improvements to be executed through close collaboration with the technical team, who adapted and made modifications to the app based on this codesign process., CONCLUSIONS: The formative research process of the app development involved theoretical underpinning, usability testing, and content design. mHealth interventions may play a key role in the future of health care, potentially addressing the barriers to participation in cardiac rehabilitation. This work will provide guidance for future research aiming to develop mobile apps by incorporating a best practice framework for mHealth intervention development and a user-centered design approach.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) improves outcomes for patients with ischemic heart disease or heart failure but is underused. New strategies to improve access to and engagement in CR are needed. There is considerable interest in technology-facilitated home CR. However, little is known about patient acceptance and use of mobile technology for CR., OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a mobile app for technology-facilitated home CR and seek to determine its usability., METHODS: We recruited patients eligible for CR who had access to a mobile phone, tablet, or computer with Internet access. The mobile app includes physical activity goal setting, logs for tracking physical activity and health metrics (eg, weight, blood pressure, and mood), health education, reminders, and feedback. Study staff demonstrated the mobile app to participants in person and then observed participants completing prespecified tasks with the mobile app. Participants completed the System Usability Scale (SUS, 0-100), rated likelihood to use the mobile app (0-100), questionnaires on mobile app use, and participated in a semistructured interview. The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology and the Theory of Planned Behavior informed the analysis. On the basis of participant feedback, we made iterative revisions to the mobile app between users., RESULTS: We conducted usability testing in 13 participants. The first version of the mobile app was used by the first 5 participants, and revised versions were used by the final 8 participants. From the first version to revised versions, task completion success rate improved from 44% (11/25 tasks) to 78% (31/40 tasks; P=.05), SUS improved from 54 to 76 (P=.04; scale 0-100, with 100 being the best usability), and self-reported likelihood of use remained high at 76 and 87 (P=.30; scale 0-100, with 100 being the highest likelihood). In interviews, patients expressed interest in tracking health measures ("I think it'll be good to track my exercise and to see what I'm doing"), a desire for introductory training ("Initially, training with a technical person, instead of me relying on myself"), and an expectation for sharing data with providers ("It would also be helpful to share with my doctor, it just being a matter of clicking a button and sharing it with my doctor")., CONCLUSIONS: With participant feedback and iterative revisions, we significantly improved the usability of a mobile app for CR. Patient expectations for using a mobile app for CR include tracking health metrics, introductory training, and sharing data with providers. Iterative mixed-method evaluation may be useful for improving the usability of health technology. Copyright ©Alexis L Beatty, Sara L Magnusson, John C Fortney, George G Sayre, Mary A Whooley.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence indicates mobile technology-based strategies may improve access to secondary prevention and reduce risk factors in cardiac patients. However, little is known about cardiac patients' use of mobile technology, particularly for health reasons and whether the usage varies across patient demographics., OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe cardiac patients' use of mobile technology and to determine variations between age groups after adjusting for education, employment, and confidence with using mobile technology., METHODS: Cardiac patients eligible for attending cardiac rehabilitation were recruited from 9 hospital and community sites across metropolitan and rural settings in New South Wales, Australia. Participants completed a survey on the use of mobile technology devices, features used, confidence with using mobile technology, willingness and interest in learning, and health-related use., RESULTS: The sample (N=282) had a mean age of 66.5 (standard deviation [SD] 10.6) years, 71.9% (203/282) were male, and 79.0% (223/282) lived in a metropolitan area. The most common diagnoses were percutaneous coronary intervention (33.3%, 94/282) and myocardial infarction (22.7%, 64/282). The majority (91.1%, 257/282) used at least one type of technology device, 70.9% (200/282) used mobile technology (mobile phone/tablet), and 31.9% (90/282) used all types. Technology was used by 54.6% (154/282) for health purposes, most often to access information on health conditions (41.4%, 117/282) and medications (34.8%, 98/282). Age had an important independent association with the use of mobile technology after adjusting for education, employment, and confidence. The youngest group (<56 years) was over 4 times more likely to use any mobile technology than the oldest (>69 years) age group (odds ratio [OR] 4.45, 95% CI 1.46-13.55), 5 times more likely to use mobile apps (OR 5.00, 95% CI 2.01-12.44), and 3 times more likely to use technology for health-related reasons (OR 3.31, 95% CI 1.34-8.18). Compared with the older group, the middle age group (56-69 years) was more than twice as likely to use any mobile technology (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.27-4.59) and mobile technology for health-related purposes (OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.04-3.53). Participants who had completed high school were twice as likely to use mobile technology (OR 2.62, 95% CI 1.45-4.70), mobile apps (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.09-3.84), and mobile technology for health-related reasons (OR 5.09, 95% CI 2.89-8.95) than those who had not completed high school. Associations were also present between participants living in metropolitan areas and mobile technology use (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.07-4.24) and employment and mobile app use (OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.44-5.140)., CONCLUSIONS: Mobile technology offers an important opportunity to improve access to secondary prevention for cardiac patients, particularly when modified to suit subgroups. High levels of mobile technology use and health motivation need to be harnessed for secondary prevention.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Use of appropriate cardioprotective medication is a cornerstone of cardiovascular disease prevention, but less-than-optimal patient adherence is common. Thus, strategies for improving adherence are recommended to adopt a multifaceted approach., OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to test a system comprising a biodegradable, ingestible sensor for direct measurement of medication ingestion in a group of patients at elevated cardiovascular risk attending a cardiac prevention and rehabilitation program., METHODS: In this prospective intervention trial in a single group of 21 patients running from April 2014 to June 2015, we measured adherence by self-report and adherence determined objectively by the system. The sensor emits a signal when it encounters the acidic environment of the stomach, detectable by an externally worn patch and linked software app. Longitudinal adherence data in the form of daily progress charts for sensed dosing events as compared with scheduled dosing are visible to patients on their tablet computer's medication dosing app, thus providing patients with continuous medication adherence feedback. We sought feedback on patient acceptability by questionnaire assessment. Participants used the system for the 12-week period of their cardiac prevention and rehabilitation program., RESULTS: Only 1 patient at initial assessment and 1 patient at end-of-program assessment reported often missing medication. The remaining patients reported never missing medication or had missing data. Only 12 (57%) of patients overall achieved system-determined adherence of 80% or more, and 3 patients had scores below 40%. Participants reported high levels of acceptability., CONCLUSIONS: This integrated system was well tolerated in a group of 21 patients over an appreciable time frame. Its ability to measure adherence reveals the sizeable disconnect between patient self-reported adherence and actual medication taking and has promising potential for clinical use as a tool to encourage better medication-taking behavior due to its ability to provide continuous patient-level feedback.

N2  - We introduce a cardiac rehabilitation program (CRP) that utilizes only a smartphone, with no external devices. As an efficient guide for cardiac rehabilitation exercise, we developed an application to automatically indicate the exercise intensity by comparing the estimated heart rate (HR) with the target heart rate zone (THZ). The HR is estimated using video images of a fingertip taken by the smartphone's built-in camera. The introduced CRP app includes pre-exercise, exercise with intensity guidance, and post-exercise. In the pre-exercise period, information such as THZ, exercise type, exercise stage order, and duration of each stage are set up. In the exercise with intensity guidance, the app estimates HR from the pulse obtained using the smartphone's built-in camera and compares the estimated HR with the THZ. Based on this comparison, the app adjusts the exercise intensity to shift the patient's HR to the THZ during exercise. In the post-exercise period, the app manages the ratio of the estimated HR to the THZ and provides a questionnaire on factors such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and leg pain during exercise, as objective and subjective evaluation indicators. As a key issue, HR estimation upon signal corruption due to motion artifacts is also considered. Through the smartphone-based CRP, we estimated the HR accuracy as mean absolute error and root mean squared error of 6.16 and 4.30bpm, respectively, with signal corruption due to motion artifacts being detected by combining the turning point ratio and kurtosis.

N2  - Medication adherence is crucial for success in the management of patients with chronic conditions. This study analyzes whether a mobile application on a tablet aimed at supporting drug intake and vital sign parameter documentation affects adherence in elderly patients.Patients with coronary heart disease and no prior knowledge of tablet computers were recruited. They received a personal introduction to the mobile application Medication Plan, installed on an Apple iPad. The study was conducted using a crossover design with 3 sequences: initial phase, interventional phase (28 days of using the app system), and comparative phase (28 days of using a paper diary). Users experienced the interventional and comparative phases alternately.A total of 24 patients (12 males; mean age 73.8 years) were enrolled in the study. The mean for subjectively assessed adherence (A14-scale; 5-point Likert scale, from "never" to "very often" which results in a score from 0 to 56) before the study was 50.0 (SD = 3.44). After both interventions there was a significant increase, which was more pronounced after the interventional phase (54.0; SD = 2.01) than after the comparative phase (52.6; SD = 2.49) (for all pairs after both interventions, P <0.001). Neither medical conditions nor the number of drug intake (amount and frequency of drug taking) per day affected subjective adherence. Logging data showed a significantly stronger adherence for the medication app than the paper system for both blood pressure recordings (P <0.001) and medication intake (P = 0.033). The majority of participants (n = 22) stated that they would like to use the medication app in their daily lives and would not need further assistance with the app.A mobile app for medication adherence increased objectively and subjectively measured adherence in elderly users undergoing rehabilitation. The findings have promising clinical implications: digital tools can assist chronic disease patients achieve adherence to medication and to blood pressure measurement. Although this requires initial offline training, it can reduce complications and clinical overload because of nonadherence.

N2  - Mobile health (mHealth) has been defined as medical and public health practice supported by mobile devices, such as mobile phones, patient monitoring devices and personal digital assistants. Cardiovascular mHealth is, arguably, leading the mHealth space, through innovation, research and implementation, and especially in the areas of prevention, cardiac rehabilitation and education. mHealth includes simple strategies, such as the use of short message service (SMS) or text messages in successful short-term smoking-cessation, weight loss and diabetes management programs. The recent Australian Tobacco, Exercise and Diet Messages (TEXT ME) randomised clinical trial addressed multiple cardiovascular risk factors. mHealth can also involve more complex strategies, such as smart phone applications (apps), global positioning systems (GPS) and Bluetooth technologies. Although many apps could be considered suitable for primary prevention, they are largely unregulated and most are not evidence-based. Some have been well-developed, such as the Food Switch app and an iPhone electrocardiogram (ECG) system. The "explosion" of apps has driven initiatives such as the Mobile Applications Rating Scale (MARS). More recently, the use of sensors to monitor and provide feedback to patients and healthcare providers is being explored. With almost two billion people currently owning a Smartphone, and 50% of adults (globally) predicted to own one by 2018, mHealth provides the prospect of delivering efficient, affordable healthcare services to widespread populations both locally and globally. In particular, it has the potential to reduce socioeconomic disparity and alleviate the burden of cardiovascular disease. There is now a need to rethink traditional health service structures and bioengineering capacity, to ensure mHealth systems are also safe, secure and robust.

N2  - Cardiovascular disease is a major health problem for all Australians and is the leading cause of death in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. In 2010, more then 50% of all heart attack deaths were due to repeated events. Cardiac rehabilitation programs have been proven to be effective in preventing the recurrence of cardiac events and readmission to hospitals. There are however, many barriers to the use of these programs. To address these barriers, CSIRO developed an IT enabled cardiac rehabilitation program delivered by mobile phone through a smartphone app and succesfully trialed it in an urban general population. If these results can be replicated in Indigenous populations, the program has the potential to significantly improve life expectancy and help close the gap in health outcomes. The challenge described in this paper is customizing the existing cardiac health program to make it culturally relevant and suitable for Indigenous Australians living in urban and remote communities.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of early death worldwide, responsible for an estimated 29% of all global deaths. Reducing salt intake lowers blood pressure and risk of secondary cardiac events. However, identifying low salt foods can be challenging. SaltSwitch is a simple smartphone application (app) that enables shoppers to scan the barcode of packaged foods and receive an immediate, interpretive, traffic light nutrition label on the screen, along with suggestions for healthier lower-salt alternatives. A growing body of evidence suggests mobile technologies can support healthy behaviour change. However, robust evidence for the impact of smartphone interventions is lacking. This manuscript outlines the rationale and methods for a randomized controlled trial designed to determine the effectiveness of SaltSwitch in supporting people with CVD to make lower-salt food choices., DESIGN/METHODS: A 6-week, two-arm, parallel, randomized controlled trial is being undertaken in New Zealand (2 weeks baseline and 4 weeks intervention). Three hundred adults aged 40 years and older with CVD and their main household shoppers are recruited from research lists, cardiac rehabilitation clinics, and communities in Auckland. Participants are randomized to receive either the SaltSwitch smartphone app or no intervention (control). Randomisation is stratified by ethnicity and age. The primary outcome is the salt content of household food purchases. Secondary outcomes are the saturated fat and energy content of household food purchases, household food expenditure, use and acceptability of the SaltSwitch app by shoppers, and urinary sodium and blood pressure of participants with CVD. Ambulatory blood pressure and potential longer-term impact (12 weeks) of SaltSwitch will be assessed in sub-studies (n ~ 40 and n ~ 20, respectively). Household purchases of salt and other nutrients will be assessed using till receipt data electronically linked with branded food composition data., DISCUSSION: The results of the SaltSwitch trial will determine the effectiveness, use and acceptability of a smartphone application to support lower salt food choices and secondary prevention of CVD., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ACTRN12614000206628.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases are the deadliest diseases worldwide, with 17.3 million deaths in 2008 alone. Among them, heart-related deaths are of the utmost relevance; a fact easily proven by the 7.25 million deaths caused by ischemic heart disease alone in that year. The latest advances in smartphones and mHealth have been used in the creation of thousands of medical apps related to cardiology, which can help to reduce these mortality rates., OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to study the literature on mobile systems and applications currently available, as well as the existing apps related to cardiology from the leading app stores and to then classify the results to see what is available and what is missing, focusing particularly on commercial apps., METHODS: Two reviews have been developed. One is a literature review of mobile systems and applications, retrieved from several databases and systems such as Scopus, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and Web of Knowledge. The other is a review of mobile apps in the leading app stores, Google play for Android and Apple's App Store for iOS., RESULTS: Search queries up to May 2013 located 406 papers and 710 apps related to cardiology and heart disease. The most researched section in the literature associated with cardiology is related to mobile heart (and vital signs) monitoring systems and the methods involved in the classification of heart signs in order to detect abnormal functions. Other systems with a significant number of papers are mobile cardiac rehabilitation systems, blood pressure measurement, and systems for the detection of heart failure. The majority of apps for cardiology are heart monitors and medical calculators. Other categories with a high number of apps are those for ECG education and interpretation, cardiology news and journals, blood pressure tracking, heart rate monitoring using an external device, and CPR instruction. There are very few guides on cardiac rehabilitation and apps for the management of the cardiac condition, and there were no apps that assist people who have undergone a heart transplant., CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of work in the field of cardiology apps is considerably disproportionate. Whereas some systems have significant research and apps are available, other important systems lack such research and lack apps, even though the contribution they could provide is significant.
